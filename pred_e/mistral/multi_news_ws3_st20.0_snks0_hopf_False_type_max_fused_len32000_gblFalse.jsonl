In the American South, he helped fund the building of over 5,300 schools for African-American children, which bore his name. He also provided seed money to build YMCAs for African-Americans and developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to improve living conditions for immigrants.\n\nThe impact of Rosenwald's philanthropy on African-American education and culture was significant.

Introducing girls to high-ranking women in their organizations and highlighting their accomplishments can make a significant impact. Additionally, girls need to understand the daily aspects of leadership, such as motivating teams, solving complex financial problems, and developing new products.\n\nMoreover, companies and schools need to make proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles.

The bill, which covers Medicaid assistance from August 2002 until Rose's death, is being sent to the estate of the deceased man. The family's attorney, Shaniece Luke, believes the bill is in retaliation for her filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency and the care facility.

The team, led by former head of the Spanish National Museum on Underwater Archaeology, Xavier Nieto Prieto, determined that the fasteners found at the site indicated a ship from a later period, likely the late 17th or 18th century. Clifford had previously announced in May that he believed he had found the Santa Maria based on geographical, underwater topography and archaeological evidence. However, Unesco experts also noted that the site where the wreck was found is further away from shore than one would expect based on contemporary accounts of Columbus' first voyage.

Unesco plans to look for the Santa Maria in a number of different locations, both on land and on the seabed. The organization's decision to reject Clifford's site and search for the Santa Maria elsewhere is likely to be controversial, as some experts believe that the bronze fasteners found at the site could have alternative explanations and that the Santa Maria could have been buried under sediment on what used to be seabed and is now coastal marshland.

The film, which stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, and Billy Crudup, is a sci-fi thriller that revitalizes the Alien franchise with its gripping storyline, beautiful visuals, and satisfying surprises. The film's central theme revolves around the origins and prospects for human life, and the balance between intelligent speculation, action, and philosophical considerations is well-executed.\n\nThe opening scene sets the tone for the film, with a synthetic named Walter engaging in a philosophical conversation with his \"father,\" an uncredited Guy Pearce. The crew of the Covenant, a giant ship headed for a distant planet, consists of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for humanity. However, when a space storm damages the ship's wind sails, the crew discovers a nearby \"hidden planet\" that seems potentially compatible to human life. Unfortunately, the beautiful landscapes hide deadly creatures that cause unimaginable mayhem.\n\nThe film also features a double performance by Michael Fassbender as Walter and his double, David, who co-starred in Prometheus. The two engage in a contest for dominance, touching on the notion of playing God. The writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, have made the most of the only source of sustained vitality in Scott's previous film, Prometheus.\n\nThe cast includes Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Carmen Ejogo, Jussie Smollett, Callie Hernandez, Amy Seimetz, Benjamin Rigby, and James Franco.

{"pred": "\n\nThe Pacific sardine population along the West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline, leading to concerns about the impact on the ecosystem and potential shifts in fishing pressure. Pacific sardines are a crucial forage fish that support a diverse range of marine species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on other forage fish species to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing hardships for fishermen, with steep cuts in catch limits and a lack of schools making it difficult to catch the fish. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is the steepest since the mid-20th century collapse of the sardine fishery. Some scientists believe that naturally occurring climate cycles, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, may be responsible for the decline.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust population cycles, and history shows that the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. The population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also taken a dive. In November 2013, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted outright.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing concern for the health of marine mammals, seabirds, and other predators that rely on the fish for food. Researchers are studying the impact of the decline on the food web and the potential for cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. The value of forage fish, such as sardines, is worth more when left in the water as food for commercially important predators, according to a report by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force.\n\nFor further information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

The study, which used data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, found that sinusitis, ear infections, and pharyngitis were the top diagnoses leading to antibiotic prescriptions, with approximately half of these prescriptions being unnecessary. The study also revealed that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being written for acute respiratory conditions. The CDC has set a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use. The overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are a major public health concern. The Pew Charitable Trusts and CDC also released a report outlining data-driven targets for eliminating unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient facilities across the country, with a focus on acute respiratory conditions. The report emphasized the importance of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. The CDC has previously identified antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest public health challenges of our time, with at least 2 million people getting an antibiotic-resistant infection and at least 23,000 people dying from these infections annually in the United States.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

Instead, the research suggests that west-facing solar panels could produce more electricity during peak demand hours and reduce homeowners' electricity usage by a greater extent.\n\nThe study analyzed 50 homes in Austin, comparing the electricity production and usage patterns of west-facing and south-facing solar panels during summer peak demand periods. The results showed that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity homeowners needed to draw from the grid during peak hours by 65 percent, while homes with the conventional true-south orientation achieved a 54 percent reduction.\n\nBrewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street and co-author of the study, explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, which is when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study also found that less electricity would go unused by homeowners with west-facing panels, making things easier for utility companies.

However, the benefits of tinkering with solar panel orientation would vary depending on the region.\n\nThe study has not been released publicly yet, but it could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes by reducing grid dependence during peak hours.

{"pred": "\n\nTwo recent studies challenge the long-held belief that removing cancerous lymph nodes from the armpit is necessary for women with early breast cancer. The first study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that for women who meet certain criteria, such as having early-stage breast cancer and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, removing cancerous nodes does not improve survival or make the cancer less likely to recur. In fact, it can cause complications like infection and lymphedema. The second study, conducted by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, also found that for women with early-stage breast cancer who undergo chemotherapy and radiation, removing additional nodes beyond the sentinel node does not improve survival. These findings are significant because surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for over a century, believing it would prolong their lives. However, with advancements in cancer treatment, it is now recognized that once the disease reaches the nodes, it has the potential to spread to vital organs and cannot be eliminated by surgery alone. These findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer and towards a more modern approach that focuses on cutting out obvious tumors and using radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places. The studies do not apply to all patients, only to those whose disease and treatment meet the specific criteria outlined in the studies. The trend towards less invasive surgery and more targeted treatments reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer and a recognition that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should not be removed to improve survival.

She says she went to a party at the mansion, where she was introduced to Cosby, who gave her a drink, though she was underage. Feeling dizzy, she lay down in a room offered by Hugh Hefner, she says. Cosby allegedly guided her to the room, and when she woke up, she says, she was naked and he was licking her toes and masturbating. \"This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself,\" she says, but after so many women have come forward, \"I feel he needs to pay for it.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4603}

Health officials have quarantined about 80 people who came into contact with the victim, one of whom has developed early symptoms of the disease. However, testing on 11 potential cases, including the victim's brother, came back negative. Marburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days and causes symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and myalgia, which are similar to many other diseases. After a few days, symptoms worsen and can include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a rash. Severe cases can lead to jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction. Marburg is not an airborne virus and is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or an infected primate or fruit bat. The first outbreak of Marburg was in Europe in 1967, and since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks, most of which have involved just a single patient. The most recent outbreak in Uganda in 2012 killed four out of 15 patients. There is no cure for Marburg, and hospitalized patients should receive general supportive therapy.

The study, which included over 15,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study II, found that women who consumed more potatoes had a higher risk of gestational diabetes, even after adjusting for other risk factors. The researchers estimate that substituting two servings of potatoes per week with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk of gestational diabetes by 9-12%. Potatoes are high on the glycemic index, meaning they can raise blood sugar levels more than most other foods. The study's authors recommend swapping potatoes with green leafy vegetables or whole grains, which are lower on the glycemic index and rich in fiber and nutrients. The findings do not mean that women should eliminate potatoes from their diet entirely, but limiting consumption to one serving per week is recommended. The study's limitations include the fact that dietary information and diabetes diagnoses were self-reported, and the severity of gestational diabetes was unknown. The authors also note that their results do not prove that potato consumption directly causes gestational diabetes, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.

A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

The losses are predominantly occurring in the West of the continent, where warm waters are getting under and melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. The study incorporates 24 independent satellite assessments and shows that Antarctica is becoming a significant player in global sea-level rise, surpassing Greenland as the dominant contributor. The latest edition of the journal Nature also includes another study that examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It suggests that the bedrock may lift up, a process called isostatic rebound, which can actually constrain ice losses by snagging on the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers.

{"pred": "\n\nIn recent news, the dangerous conditions on Mount Everest have come under scrutiny following a tragic avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas and injured several others. The avalanche occurred on April 18, 2014, and was triggered by a massive ice bulge that had been hanging precariously over the main route up the Nepal side of the mountain. The incident marked the worst climbing accident in Everest's history and highlighted the risks faced by Sherpas, who make up a small percentage of the Nepali population but comprise the majority of the mountain's climbing workforce.\n\nRussell Brice, a New Zealand mountaineer and owner of the commercial guiding operation Himalayan Experience (Himex), had expressed concerns about the ice bulge earlier in the season and had even pulled his team off the mountain in 2012 due to similar concerns. However, his decision was met with criticism at the time, and Himex's reputation took a hit.\n\nThe avalanche also brought attention to the disparity in risk between Sherpas and Western climbers. While the number of deaths among Western climbers and guides has decreased in recent years due to advances in technology and weather forecasting, the death rate for climbing Sherpas has been much higher. According to one report, the death rate for climbing Sherpas from 2004 to 2014 was twelve times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003 to 2007.\n\nIn response to the avalanche, the Sherpas announced that they would go on strike unless the Nepali government agreed to meet their demands, which included increased compensation for families of the deceased and disabled Sherpas, a permanent relief fund, and higher insurance benefits. The strike threatened to disrupt the climbing season, which had already seen a significant number of teams abandon the mountain due to the dangerous conditions.\n\nThe incident also raised questions about the commercialization of Mount Everest and the role of foreign-owned guiding companies in exploiting the Sherpas.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The team, led by Karel Kleisner, used static facial photographs of 80 men and 80 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. The study revealed that men with higher IQ scores were perceived as more intelligent based on their facial features, specifically a longer face, wider distance between the eyes, larger nose, and sharper chin. However, these facial features did not correlate with actual IQ scores.\n\nThe researchers also found that the halo effect of attractiveness may prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women. Women's faces were rated based on their attractiveness rather than intelligence. The team suggests that this could be due to the fact that women are often judged based on their attractiveness, making it difficult to separate the two traits.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLoS One, also found that there was no correlation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. The researchers used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence and found that faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nThe researchers suggest that this ability to accurately assess the intelligence of men from their faces may have important evolutionary consequences. They propose that this could be due to the fact that intelligence is at least partly heritable, and that facial indicators of intelligence are sexually dimorphic and apparent only in men's faces due to genetic and developmental associations to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty. Alternatively, women may be pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, making it difficult to accurately assess their intelligence.

The researchers have not yet observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects. The planet is believed to have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system, as Pluto, which spent three-quarters of a century as the iconic ninth planet, was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to Brown's observations of the outer solar system. Brown has been working on finding a new planet to replace Pluto for his daughter, who was disappointed by its demotion.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine is still a big unknown, and further observations and detections of perturbed bodies would bolster the hypothesis. NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. However, he is personally excited about the new research.\n\nBrown and Batygin initially set out to prove that Planet Nine didn't exist but ultimately concluded that the best explanation for the smaller objects' clustering was the gravitational effects of something far bigger. The clustering is similar to what's seen in some asteroids that are about as close to the sun as the Earth.\n\nThe situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit, leading eventually to the discovery of Neptune.\n\nIf and when it's spotted, Planet Nine would be evaluated by the same criteria that got Pluto demoted.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

Astronomers have measured the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy, and the numbers indicate that the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe. This discrepancy may offer insights into the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and don't emit light. Researchers believe that dark matter and the dark energy it carries may explain the acceleration of the universe's expansion. The most recent calculation of the universe's rate of expansion, called the Hubble constant, is believed to be the most accurate ever, with a margin of error of just 2.4 percent. However, astronomers expected the new calculations to forge an agreeable link with those derived from observations of the Big Bang afterglow collected by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Instead, the ends of the measurements do not quite meet in the middle, and researchers are continuing to go over the data to try to reduce the margin for error even further. Some scientists urge caution, suggesting that the most likely explanation is a mistake in the most recent calculations. However, if the science is correct, it could challenge some of the basic precepts surrounding the functioning of our universe. Possible explanations include the possibility that dark energy is pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed, or that dark matter has some as-yet undiscovered oddities. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate. The new numbers are based on the team's efforts to acquire a more precise understanding of the universe's current expansion rate, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope. The team refined the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae. By measuring about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and comparing the apparent brightness of both types of stars, the researchers were able to determine the true brightness of the Type Ia supernovae and calculate distances to roughly 300 of them in far-fl", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

While Finding Dory continued its success with the biggest third weekend for an animated movie, The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG underperformed. The BFG, a $140 million adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's novel, brought in only $22.2 million domestically and $3.9 million overseas in its opening weekend. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg, stars Mark Rylance as a friendly giant and Ruby Barnhill as a young orphan. Despite positive reviews and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, the film failed to attract large crowds.\n\nThe reasons for The BFG's poor performance are unclear. Some believe that Spielberg's box office clout has waned, while others argue that Roald Dahl's books don't have the same built-in audience as J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. The title of the film, which stands for \"Big Friendly Giant,\" may also be confusing to modern audiences. Additionally, the film lacked recognizable stars and had a high production budget. The giant's appearance, which some find more scary than friendly, may have also deterred families from attending.\n\nDespite The BFG's disappointing box office performance, Spielberg's career as a director remains strong.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

Suh and her companions had to make the dangerous journey from China to Laos, avoiding detection by police. Once they arrived in Laos, they applied for asylum in various countries, including the United States.\n\nThe situation for North Korean women in China is precarious, as they are often trapped in remote villages where they cannot communicate with locals and are at risk of being discovered and repatriated to North Korea. The Chinese government does not fully meet the minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking, and North Korean women are subjected to sexual slavery, forced prostitution, and compulsory labor.\n\nThe number of North Korean women working in China has increased due to the country's tightened security and the high demand for foreign currency. Women ages 15 to 25 are the most prized and can fetch prices between $10,000 and $12,000, while women in their 30s can be acquired for half that price. Some Chinese families are spending their entire life savings to buy a North Korean woman, and as a result, they are sometimes shackled inside the house.\n\nThe women who perform online sex work often do so out of necessity, as they have few other opportunities to earn money.

The group has been able to swell its ranks with both homegrown fighters and foreigners drawn from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia.\n\nThe Obama administration, which has been criticized for tagging al-Nusra a terrorist organization, will likely use Al-Baghdadi's remarks as final justification for its designation.

The website offers real-time counseling from trained professionals, who will provide step-by-step instructions on using misoprostol for a DIY abortion and connect women with abortion funds if necessary.\n\nThe inspiration for the project came from the fact that many US women are already attempting to induce their own abortions without medical supervision, particularly along the US-Mexico border, where misoprostol can be legally purchased over the counter. The project will not provide abortion-inducing drugs to women in the US, but will instead focus on providing information and support.\n\nHowever, the legal implications of the project are uncertain. While looking for or giving out information about self-induced abortion is protected by law, some women have faced prosecution for attempting to self-induce. The act of seeking information or assistance for a self-induced abortion could potentially compound the risk of prosecution.\n\nDespite these risks, Women Help Women argues that the project is necessary in the current climate, where millions of women have been left without affordable abortion options due to restrictions and closures of clinics.

The crisis began in the mid-1990s when Greece consistently spent more than it collected in tax revenues, leading to a growing debt burden. In 2010, Greece received a bailout, but the support came with requirements to end deficit spending and reform the economy. However, the bailout failed to address the underlying issues, and Greece's economy continued to struggle.\n\nIn 2015, the Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, sought to renegotiate the terms of the bailout, but creditors have refused to make significant concessions. Tsipras has called for a referendum to strengthen his hand in negotiations, but the high-stakes standoff has resulted in Greece defaulting on debts, closing banks, and losing access to billions of euros as the existing bailout deal expired.\n\nThe two sides are evenly split in the polls, with about 75% of people wanting Greece to remain in the euro currency.

However, in biblical times, the Lord commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage, which is the marriage of one man and more than one woman. This practice was instituted among some early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through revelations given to Joseph Smith in the early 1840s.\n\nPlural marriage was a challenging aspect of the Restoration for both Joseph Smith and other Church members. It violated cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and opposition. However, many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them courage to accept this practice.\n\nThe historical record of early plural marriage is thin due to its incremental introduction and the participants' reluctance to discuss their experiences publicly. The revelation on plural marriage, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, emerged from Joseph Smith's study of the Old Testament in 1831 and was part of a larger revelation on eternal marriage.\n\nPlural marriage was practiced in Nauvoo, Illinois, between 1841 and 1846, and was motivated by religious reasons, such as the hope of living in God's presence with family members. The first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed in April 1841. Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage.\n\nDespite the challenges, plural marriage benefited the Church in numerous ways, including the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes and the creation of a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints. However, it also led to misunderstandings and difficulties, particularly when it came to implementing and discontinuing the practice.\n\nBeginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage, and after the U.S. Supreme Court found these laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The studies, conducted using the video game Halo 3, observed that lower-skilled male players were more likely to make hostile comments towards female-voiced teammates, especially when performing poorly. In contrast, higher-skilled male players were more positive towards female teammates, potentially trying to attract their attention. The researchers argue that this behavior is an attempt by low-status males to maintain their social rank and access to potential mates. The findings are significant because they provide insight into the factors that contribute to sexist behavior in online environments, where physical differences are inconsequential yet women receive a disproportionate amount of negative comments from men. The studies also highlight the importance of considering both social and biological perspectives when exploring the causes of sexist behavior.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

Wright (1977) that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools. The Court held that the Eighth Amendment was designed to protect those convicted of crimes and that there is no need to extend its protections to public school disciplinary practices. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also does not require notice and hearing prior to imposition of corporal punishment. The Court found that the openness of the public school environment and the legal constraints of the common law provide significant safeguards against unjustified corporal punishment. The Florida scheme, which authorized punishment within the limits of the common law privilege, was found to afford significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment of school children. The Court rejected the petitioners' substantive and procedural contentions. The case involved two students, James Ingraham and Roosevelt Andrews, who filed a class action lawsuit against school officials in Dade County, Florida, alleging that they had been subjected to excessive corporal punishment in violation of their constitutional rights. The evidence showed that the paddling of petitioners was exceptionally harsh, with Ingraham suffering a hematoma requiring medical attention and keeping him out of school for several days, and Andrews being paddled several times for minor infractions, resulting in physical injuries. The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the complaint, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Traditional central power stations and transmission systems include equipment that is decades old and physically unable to handle electronic threats, and some run on software that is so old that malware protections don't exist.

The rebuttal includes a Nobel laureate's rejection of the scientific evidence in the report and a claim that team attendant Jim McNally referred to himself as \"the deflator\" because he was losing weight, not because he was removing air pressure from Tom Brady's footballs. The NFL Players Union has officially appealed Brady's four-game suspension for allegedly having \"at least a general awareness\" of the scandal and failing to fully cooperate with investigators. The Patriots' lawyer, Daniel L. Goldberg, accused the investigators of ignoring inconsistencies in logic and evidence and manipulating evidence to show that Brady preferred underinflated footballs and that McNally and equipment assistant John Jastremski probably cheated to satisfy Brady's desires. The website went up shortly before the deadline for the team to appeal its penalties, which include a $1 million fine and the loss of two draft picks. The NFL has yet to comment on the rebuttal. The Patriots acknowledge no wrongdoing by Brady, McNally, or Jastremski, but have indefinitely suspended McNally and Jastremski without pay. The rebuttal repeatedly characterizes the interpretation of events and evidence in the Wells report as flawed or offers alternative explanations. One of the most jarring assertions is aimed at countering the interpretation of McNally describing himself as \"the deflator.\" While Jastremski is thin and works out to bulk up, McNally is a big fellow and had the opposite goal: to lose weight. McNally's texts to Jastremski, which the Wells report described as compelling evidence of wrongdoing, are instead characterized as mocking Jastremski's concern that his boss would discover he had secretly been giving McNally sneakers and other Patriots property. The Patriots also question the scientific evidence in the report, citing a Nobel Prize recipient's conclusion that the findings are incorrect.

This hemispheric specialization, which is more pronounced in males than females, allows bats to distinguish communication sounds from each other using the fast timing of the left hemisphere and use the slow timing of the right hemisphere for sonar to track the velocity of insects. This finding challenges the notion that only humans use different sides of their brains for sound processing and opens up new avenues for studying bat brains to understand certain human language disorders and potentially improve computer speech recognition. The study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The researchers report having no personal financial interests related to the study. Georgetown University Medical Center is an internationally recognized academic medical center with a mission of research, teaching, and patient care, emphasizing public service and the Jesuit principle of cura personalis.\n\nPassage 1 discussed the mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii), a species native to North, South, and Central America with a wingspan of up to 1.9 feet and squat, pointed ears.

{"pred": "\n\nHurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that made landfall in Texas, has brought unprecedented flooding and devastation to the region. The storm has raised important questions about the role of climate change in intensifying extreme weather events. According to scientists, warmer air and water caused by climate change can lead to wetter and more intense hurricanes in the future. Harvey's rainfall was made worse by the fact that the Gulf of Mexico was nearly 2 degrees warmer than normal, and the storm was fueled by warm water that ran more than 300 feet deep.\n\nThe storm's heavy rainfall and flooding have broken numerous records, with some areas receiving as much as 48 inches of rain. The storm's slow movement and stalling over Texas were also influenced by climate change, as some scientists believe that melting sea ice in the Arctic and changes in the jet stream could be contributing to more frequent \"blocking fronts\" that cause storms to stall.\n\nDespite the evidence linking climate change to more intense and frequent storms, some politicians and media outlets have downplayed or denied the connection. Fox News, in particular, has criticized CNN for bringing up climate change in its coverage of the storm, with some hosts suggesting that the network is politicizing the crisis. However, many scientists agree that climate change is a significant factor in the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and that it is important to acknowledge this connection in order to better understand and prepare for the future.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey has also highlighted the importance of funding and resources for disaster relief and recovery efforts. In the past, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for disaster aid, with some conservatives pushing for offsetting budget cuts. The response to Hurricane Harvey will once again test the nation's ability to come together and provide the necessary resources for those affected by the storm.\n\nOverall, Hurricane Harvey serves as a stark reminder of the need to address the challenges posed by climate change and to invest in disaster relief and recovery efforts. The storm's devastating impact on Texas and the Gulf Coast underscores the importance of taking action to mitigate the risks of extreme weather events and to support those affected by these events.", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

However, his transplant did not go as planned, and he remained in critical condition for three months before dying. His wife, Jennifer, documented their journey on Facebook, sharing updates with friends and family.\n\nMeanwhile, Kveton and his wife, Judy, also received a call that a heart was available for him in early 2018. They drove to Houston, hoping for a successful transplant. However, Kveton's new heart went into shock, and he was connected to a life-support machine. His wife was told that too much time may have passed between the organ being removed from the donor and implanted in him. The surgical director, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan, took over from the initial surgeon, Dr. Masahiro Ono. Kveton underwent several procedures, including being connected to a pair of external heart pumps, and was eventually given a SynCardia total artificial heart.

The rules require at least three \"sober and lucid\" members to monitor behavior at parties, prohibit pre-mixed alcoholic drinks, and implement guest lists to control entry to the houses during events. One of the sober party monitors must be posted at a staircase leading to bedrooms and have immediate key access to each room to prevent situations that could lead to sexual assault. The new rules come in response to a Rolling Stone magazine article that depicted a female student saying she was gang-raped at a fraternity house during her freshman year. However, the article unraveled last month as key elements of the rape allegation fell into doubt, and the magazine's managing editor apologized for journalistic lapses. Despite this, university officials and Greek organization leaders pledged to continue efforts to improve safety at UVA. The university also released safety addendums for its agreements with sororities and fraternities, promising steps to promote \"bystander intervention\" and educational programs on alcohol use and safe parties. UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan announced the suspension of social activities for campus Greek organizations in November, but has now lifted the suspension on condition that each chapter agrees to the new safety provisions by January 16. The new rules are designed to make parties safer and prevent situations that could lead to sexual violence. The university is under investigation by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for its handling of sexual assault allegations. The new rules are part of a larger effort to address sexual violence on college campuses, following a number of high-profile cases and increasing scrutiny of how universities respond to such allegations.

Over the last decade, 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 have been repeatedly flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) over suspicions they have thrown matches. All of the players, including winners of Grand Slam titles, were allowed to continue competing. The TIU, which was set up to police the sport, has a zero-tolerance approach to betting-related corruption but has been criticized for not thoroughly investigating the issue. Chris Kermode, who heads the Association of Tennis Professionals, has rejected claims that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed and will investigate any new information. The documents obtained by the BBC and BuzzFeed News include the findings of an investigation set up in 2007 by the Association of Tennis Professionals, which found betting syndicates in Russia, northern Italy, and Sicily making hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on matches they believed to be fixed. Three of these matches were at Wimbledon. The enquiry team recommended that 28 players involved in these matches be investigated, but the findings were never followed up. Tennis introduced a new anti-corruption code in 2009 but was advised that previous corruption offenses could not be pursued. As a result, no new investigations into any of the players who were mentioned in the 2008 report were opened.

After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets.

He retired to his room earlier than others and was discovered unresponsive the following morning. A priest was called to administer last rites.\n\nScalia was a conservative icon on the court, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. He was the longest-serving member of the current Supreme Court and was known for his belief in originalism, interpreting the Constitution according to the original authors' intentions. His death has far-reaching implications for the Supreme Court, as there are several major cases pending this summer, including Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which challenges the university's affirmative action policy, and a case that contests Obama's immigration policy.\n\nThe replacement for Scalia would be President Barack Obama's third Supreme Court nomination. Republican senators have suggested that the Senate should not entertain a nomination from Obama, but Democratic leaders argue that the Senate has a constitutional responsibility to fill the vacancy. The political fight over Scalia's successor is likely to be a dominant theme in the presidential election.\n\nScalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and attended Georgetown University and Harvard Law School. He was a devout Catholic and leaves behind his wife Maureen and nine children. His death has been met with condolences from political figures on both sides of the aisle, including President Obama, who called Scalia a \"towering legal figure.\"\n\nThe sudden death of Scalia will have an immediate impact on numerous cases now pending before the Supreme Court, including several that were expected to split along ideological or political lines with 5-4 votes. Instead, some of those votes now could deadlock, 4 to 4, meaning a lower court decision stands and there is no precedent set by the high court.\n\nScalia's impact on the legal world was significant.

The spacecraft will be equipped with a 7.5-foot-wide, 4.5-inch-thick heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material and will carry four science instruments to measure the sun's electric and magnetic fields, photograph solar structure, and study the solar wind. The mission aims to answer two long-standing puzzles: how is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface? Understanding these questions is important for protecting equipment from solar radiation and could potentially save billions of dollars in damage. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to the sun and its outermost atmosphere, called the corona, and will carry a chip with photographs of Parker and his revolutionary paper predicting the existence of solar wind. The mission was initially called Solar Probe Plus but was renamed to honor Parker, who is still alive and was present at the announcement. The Parker Solar Probe will revolutionize mankind's understanding of the sun and the origins of physics and could also help protect equipment from solar radiation. The mission is expected to launch on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 31, 2018.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

However, the cause of the Hunley's sinking and the fate of its crew have remained a mystery for over 150 years. A new study published in the journal Plos One suggests that the crew did not drown or suffocate, but instead died instantly from the shockwave generated by their own torpedo explosion.\n\nThe study, led by biomechanist Rachel Lance, used a scale model of the Hunley and conducted underwater blast experiments to evaluate the risk to the crew from the torpedo explosion. The results showed that the secondary wave transmitted inside the crew compartment was of sufficient magnitude that the calculated chances of survival were less than 16% for each crew member.\n\nThe Hunley was raised from the ocean floor in 2000, and conservation efforts have been ongoing since. The skeletal remains of the crewmembers were found seated at their respective stations, with no physical injuries or apparent attempts to escape. The conning towers, which formed the only path of escape, were closed with the aft tower still securely locked. The bilge pumps were not set to pump out water, and the keel ballast weights remained firmly attached.\n\nPrevious theories, such as suffocation and damage to the hull from arms fire, have been found to be implausible. The two large holes discovered in the bow and side of the hull were determined not to be the cause of sinking, as they occurred long after the sinking and no additional damage was found to the hull.\n\nThe Hunley was a narrow, tapered submarine, 12 m (40 ft) long with a maximum width of only 1.2 m (4 ft), shaped out of the wrought iron boiler of a previous ship, and carried a crew of 8 men. The Hunley sank the Union ship Housatonic and killed 5 Union soldiers by setting off a black powder torpedo against the ship’s hull on the evening of February 17, 1864.\n\nThe study's findings offer fresh insights into human physiology and the physical forces we're able—or unable—to endure.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

The bill aims to establish a single-payer health care system in the United States, where the government provides insurance coverage for all Americans. The proposal has gained momentum since Sanders' insurgent campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, during which he advocated for universal health care.\n\nThe bill has garnered support from several potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The simple tenant of the proposal is to put in place a single-payer system, akin to those used in the U.K., France, Australia, Canada, and others, which offers universal health care and no requirement to get insurance through an employer.\n\nSanders has argued that health care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege, and that every man, woman, and child in the country should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income. The plan would be funded primarily through a progressive tax system, with the richest households paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, among others. Sanders claims the plan would save Americans and businesses $6 trillion over the next decade.\n\nDespite the widespread support for the bill among Democrats, it has no chance of passing with the Senate and House controlled by Republicans. However, Sanders has succeeded in pushing the issue further into the spotlight and pressuring Democrats to take a stance on it. The support for the bill has become a practical litmus test for the party's 2020 presidential hopefuls.\n\nSingle-payer health care systems have been shown to be more cost-effective than the current model in the United States. However, the exact savings under Sanders' plan remain a topic of debate. Polls have shown that Americans have already moved in the direction of supporting single-payer health care, with 60 percent of Americans saying the federal government should be responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans.\n\nUpdate: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Kirsten Gillibrand. This has been corrected.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

In the early days of space travel, there was no thought given to astronauts' bathroom needs during flights. The first manned spaceflight, the Mercury program, lacked a urine collection device, and astronauts had to improvise solutions. Alan Shepard, the first American in space, was denied permission to leave his capsule to use the bathroom and was forced to urinate in his suit. Gus Grissom, the second American in space, was given a makeshift urine collection system consisting of a garter belt and condom.\n\nAs space missions became longer, astronauts needed more advanced bathroom solutions. For longer missions, external urine collection devices were used, and for the Gemini program, a fecal containment system was developed. This system consisted of a foot-long tube-shaped bag with an adhesive lining and crystals to absorb moisture and neutralize odors.\n\nThe larger Apollo spacecraft afforded more privacy for astronauts, but they still had to deal with diapers while on the moon. Neil Armstrong and other moon-walking astronauts wore diapers underneath their pressure suits to collect urine. However, accidents did happen, and Charlie Duke experienced an unattached urine collection system during Apollo 16, resulting in a squishy left boot.\n\nLonger-term missions on the International Space Station have led to advances in washroom technology, and the shift to mixed-gender crews has made privacy a necessity.

Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

{"pred": "\n\nThree recent legal developments have expanded the liability of distracted driving accidents beyond the driver. In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident will face negligence and wrongful-death claims. This decision follows a New Jersey appellate ruling from 2013 that established third parties who are aware they are texting a distracted driver can be liable for the driver’s accidents. However, the Pennsylvania ruling sets a high bar for plaintiffs to prove that the third parties were aware the driver was texting and would view the text while on the road.\n\nMeanwhile, New York lawmakers have proposed an even more aggressive tactic to crack down on phone use behind the wheel: textalyzers. This technology would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. The textalyzer bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nPrivacy advocates have denounced the textalyzer initiative, but some legal experts believe these developments could signal a shift in how society takes on distracted driving. Distracted driving is becoming more stigmatized, and society may start to hold phone companies and app developers accountable for accidents. However, it remains to be seen whether this will happen anytime soon.\n\nIn 2014, there were nearly 3,200 reported American deaths and 431,000 injuries from distracted driver incidents. Distracted driving rates are increasing every year, and studies show that distracted driving-related incidents are difficult to track because most distracted drivers involved in wrecks don't report that they were using a cell phone at the time of the crash. With each new social media app, drivers have more temptation to look away from the road and more foolish ways to get into wrecks.\n\nOne example is the case of Christal McGee, who hit an Uber driver, Wentworth Maynard, while Snapchatting a bloody selfie from a stretcher after the crash. Maynard is now suing Snapchat for “motivating” McGee to drive recklessly.\n\nThese legal developments could help reduce texting-related accidents by putting people on notice that they can be held liable", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

The operation, which lasted for seven hours, saw police fire nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition in a battle with a group of terrorists holed up in two apartments. The raid was launched based on a witness report received on Monday, which led investigators to believe that Abaaoud, a known Belgian jihadist believed to be in Syria, was in fact in France.\n\nThe police assault was met with resistance as the reinforced door of the apartment resisted explosives laid by RAID (anti-terror police), allowing the terrorists to prepare their defense.
