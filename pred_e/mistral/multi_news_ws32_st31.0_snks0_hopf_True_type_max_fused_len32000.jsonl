Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest.

The gender disparity in leadership roles persists, with women holding only 3.6% of Fortune 500 CEO positions. To address this issue, companies need to take action beyond a single day in April.\n\nFirst, introducing girls to female role models is crucial. Companies can bring their highest-ranking women to career days and highlight their achievements. This exposure can inspire girls to aspire to leadership positions.\n\nSecond, girls need to understand the specifics of leadership roles. They should learn about the responsibilities, motivations, and rewards of leadership from a young age. This knowledge can help them make informed decisions about their careers and close the ambition gap.\n\nThird, companies should support programs that actively identify and groom female talent. This can include sponsorship initiatives, where executives use their political capital to advocate for their protégés. These efforts can lead to more women in leadership roles and help close the gender gap.\n\nPrinceton University took a proactive approach to this issue when it found that the number of female students winning top academic honors had declined. The university implemented initiatives to encourage female students to apply for academic awards and actively sought to promote women into leadership roles.\n\nIn conclusion, it's time to take our daughters beyond the workplace and into the C-suite.

However, these AFPs come with a paradoxical cost: they not only prevent freezing but also inhibit melting, leading to the accumulation of ice within the fish's body.

They found that the AFPs not only prevent ice formation but also hinder ice melting, which could potentially be harmful to the fish.\n\nThe researchers investigated the impact of this ice accumulation on notothenioid fishes by examining temperature records from a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat and conducting experiments in the lab. They found that the ice melting inhibition occurs both in vitro and in vivo, meaning that the ice persists inside the fish even during summer months when temperatures rise. This finding exposes a potential antagonistic pleiotropy, where the beneficial effect of AFPs in preventing freezing comes with the cost of lifelong ice accumulation.\n\nThe researchers emphasized that more research is needed to understand how notothenioid fishes eliminate internal ice and whether there are any mechanisms to mitigate the potential risks associated with ice accumulation.

{"pred": "\n\nThe Pacific coast of North America hosts a diverse and thriving marine ecosystem, with Pacific sardines playing a crucial role as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, and commercially important fish. However, the sardine population has experienced a significant decline, leading to concerns about the potential consequences for the ecosystem and the fishing industry. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has been urged to take action to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean by implementing conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing of forage fish.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is attributed to their naturally volatile nature and the impact of climate conditions. The Pacific sardine population has historically fluctuated widely, with the current decline being the most severe in over a decade. The reasons for the decline are not entirely clear, but some scientists believe that the recent cold water conditions, brought about by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, may be a contributing factor.\n\nThe sardine decline has already had far-reaching consequences, with predators such as brown pelicans, sea lions, and other fish experiencing food shortages. The impact on the fishing industry has also been significant, with many fishermen struggling to make a living due to the scarcity of sardines.\n\nHistorically, sardine populations have recovered when ocean conditions improve, but the current decline has raised concerns due to the lack of understanding of the underlying causes. Some experts argue that continuing to fish for sardines could further exacerbate the decline and hinder any potential recovery.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is not the only forage fish experiencing population declines. Other species, such as anchovies and herring, are also facing similar challenges. The value of forage fish, which account for over a third of the global catch, is estimated to be worth twice as much when left in the water to support larger, more valuable species.\n\nThe PFMC has implemented measures to help maintain healthy forage fish populations, including setting catch limits and implementing regulations to protect vulnerable species. However, some environmental groups argue that more needs to be done to ensure the long-term health of these important species and the ecosystems they support.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in Pacific sardine populations and the impact on the ecosystem and fishing industry highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the complex challenges facing marine ecosystems. The PF", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

The study, which analyzed data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, found that out of 136 million antibiotic prescriptions, 43 million were potentially unnecessary. The most common conditions for which antibiotics were prescribed unnecessarily were acute respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and urinary tract infections. The study also found that children were more likely to receive unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions than adults.\n\nThe CDC has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest public health challenges of our time, with at least 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occurring in the United States each year and resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. The overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making infections harder to treat and increasing healthcare costs.\n\nThe study comes as part of the CDC's National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which includes goals to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ensure that antibiotics are used effectively when they are needed. The CDC is working with healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients to promote appropriate antibiotic use and reduce unnecessary prescriptions.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of public education about antibiotic use and the risks of antibiotic resistance. The CDC encourages patients to ask their healthcare providers whether an antibiotic prescription is necessary and to take the full course of antibiotics if prescribed. The agency also advises against using leftover antibiotics or sharing them with others.\n\nThe CDC is not alone in its efforts to combat antibiotic resistance.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times.

However, subsequent attempts to locate the snake failed, and it was assumed to be extinct or a labelling error.\n\nRecently, researchers Daniel Mulcahy from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Juan Martinez Gomez from Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find the elusive snake. They followed Beebe's original field notes and timed their expedition to replicate his steps. One of Martinez Gomez's graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot the snake since 1936.\n\nDNA analysis confirmed that the snake was indeed the Clarion nightsnake and was genetically distinct from other snakes found in mainland Mexico. The researchers also discovered that the snake's ancestors may have traveled to the island on a tree trunk that was washed ashore during a storm.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is now recognized as a distinct species and is found exclusively on Clarion Island. Its rediscovery is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems and the potential loss of biodiversity. The National Museum of Natural History in Washington hailed Mulcahy's discovery as an important contribution to scientific knowledge and a reminder of the importance of historical data and museum collections.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is not the only rare species to have been rediscovered on the Revillagigedo Islands.

In South Africa, a 45-year-old man died of Marburg virus in Johannesburg in October 2022. He had recently traveled to Uganda.\n\nThe Marburg virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. The incubation period is typically between 2-21 days. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and vomiting, followed by hemorrhagic symptoms such as bleeding from the eyes, ears, and nose. The case-fatality rate is between 24% and 88%.\n\nUpon identification of the outbreaks, health authorities in both countries implemented strict infection control measures and contacted the World Health Organization (WHO) for assistance.

The study, which followed over 15,000 nurses for 20 years, found that those who ate more than six servings of potatoes a week had a 21% higher risk of developing gestational diabetes compared to those who ate less than one serving a week. The researchers believe this may be due to the high glycemic index of potatoes, which can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. However, UK experts caution that more research is needed before women are advised to avoid potatoes altogether.\n\nThe study also found that swapping potatoes for other starchy foods, such as rice or pasta, could help reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. The researchers suggest that women aim for a balanced diet, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to help manage their blood sugar levels and reduce their risk of developing gestational diabetes.\n\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can increase the risk of complications for both the mother and baby. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. It is usually diagnosed through routine screening during pregnancy.\n\nThe study adds to growing evidence that diet plays a crucial role in gestational diabetes risk.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

It tells the story of ancient peoples who lived in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans and describes their beliefs and practices.\n\nThe Church's push for transparency also comes as it faces challenges from within. Some members have criticized the Church for its handling of sexual abuse allegations and its response", "answers": ["To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the \"seer stone\" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the \"printer's manuscript\" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from \"reformed Egyptian\" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: \"Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.\" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a \"a series of miraculous events.\" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more \"tangible\" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. \"Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting.\" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 7900}

The company, which owns the popular messaging app Snapchat, has seen impressive growth in recent years, with daily active users increasing from 100 million in late 2015 to over 158 million as of December 2016. However, the company has yet to turn a profit and faces intense competition from other social media giants like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe lead-up to the IPO has been rocky, with concerns over the company's slowing user growth and lack of profitability. Snap's revenue for 2016 was reportedly around $370 million, and the company is expected to lose around $500 million in 2017. Despite these concerns, investors are eager to get in on what could be a hot IPO, with some predicting it could be the biggest tech IPO since Facebook's in 2012.\n\nOne issue that could impact Snap's future growth is its aging user base. While the app remains popular among younger users, it has struggled to attract older demographics. Additionally, the company faces stiff competition from Facebook and Instagram, which have copied many of Snapchat's features and have much larger user bases.\n\nAnother concern for investors is Snap's lack of profitability and its heavy spending on research and development. The company has yet to monetize its user base effectively, and its revenue growth has been slow. However, Snap has been experimenting with new revenue streams, including sponsored geofilters and sponsored lenses, which have shown promising results.\n\nDespite these challenges, Snap has some unique features that could help it stand out from the competition. Its ephemeral messaging app, which allows users to send messages that disappear after they are viewed, has proven to be popular among younger users. Additionally, the company has been investing heavily in hardware, including its Spectacles glasses, which allow users to capture and share videos in a more immersive way.\n\nUltimately, Snap's success as a public company will depend on its ability to monetize its user base and stay competitive in a rapidly changing social media landscape", "answers": ["Those who remember the hype when Alibaba priced its initial public offering of stock in 2014 will get to relive that excitement Wednesday when Snap does the same.

Astronomers have used data from 19 galaxies to determine the universe's expansion rate, which is now estimated to be 73.5 kilometers per second per megaparsec, up from the previous estimate of 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This discrepancy could be due to inaccuracies in the measurements or new physics yet to be discovered.\n\nThe new findings challenge the current understanding of the universe's expansion and could have significant implications for our understanding of dark energy and the nature of the universe itself. Some scientists believe that the discrepancy could be explained by the presence of dark matter or dark energy, while others suggest that it could be due to errors in the measurements or new physics yet to be discovered.\n\nThe Hubble constant, which measures the rate of the universe's expansion, has been a subject of debate for decades. The new measurements could help resolve this long-standing mystery and provide new insights into the fundamental nature of the universe.\n\nThe discovery also raises questions about the validity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) measurements, which are used to estimate the Hubble constant based on the age of the universe. Some scientists believe that the discrepancy between the Hubble constant measurements and the CMB measurements could be due to errors in the assumptions used to calculate the age of the universe from the CMB data.\n\nThe new findings have been met with excitement and skepticism from the scientific community. Some scientists have called for more data and more precise measurements to confirm the results, while others have suggested that the discrepancy could be explained by new physics, such as modifications to general relativity or the presence of new particles.\n\nOverall, the new measurements of the universe's expansion rate are a significant development in our understanding of the cosmos.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo.

{"pred": "\n\nLouisiana is facing a severe blood shortage due to flooding and the Zika virus. The South Texas Blood and Tissue Center in San Antonio is urging people to donate blood to help Louisiana, as they are already experiencing a shortage. The summer months are difficult for blood donations due to students being out of school and vacationers being away. Additionally, the Zika virus is causing a shortage as pregnant women are being advised not to donate blood. The Zika virus is also posing a threat in the aftermath of the flooding in Louisiana, as the standing water could lead to an increase in mosquitoes carrying the virus. The mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, thrive in urban areas and can transmit the virus to people through mosquito bites. The Zika virus can cause birth defects in babies if pregnant women are infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring the situation closely and advising pregnant women to avoid traveling to areas with Zika outbreaks. The CDC also recommends that men who have traveled to areas with Zika outbreaks wait at least six months before trying to conceive. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika virus a global health emergency in February 2016. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 and has since spread to over 60 countries. The virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito, but it can also be sexually transmitted. There is no cure or vaccine for the Zika virus, and the best prevention is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. People can protect themselves by wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in places with air conditioning or screens on windows. The CDC also advises pregnant women to consider postponing travel to areas with Zika outbreaks. The Zika virus can also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth, and it can cause microcephaly, a condition where the baby's head is smaller than normal and the brain does not develop properly. The CDC is working to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus, but it is not yet available. The WHO is also working to control the spread of the virus by increasing awareness and providing resources", "answers": ["As thousands of people deal with treacherous flooding in southern Louisiana, a new danger may enter into the mix: increased risk of a mosquito surge over the next few weeks, and with them, the potential spread of the Zika virus, a tropical medicine expert tells USA Today. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The first, a pretzel croissant called the pretzel croissant or pretzel Danish, was introduced by Maury Rubin at City Bakery and has been coexisting with Dominique Ansel's creation, the Cronut, since 2003. The Cronut, a deep-fried croissant-doughnut hybrid, gained popularity in 2013 and sparked a trend of hybrid pastries.\n\nDominique Ansel, the creator of the Cronut, opened his bakery in 2011 and initially struggled with long lines and high demand. He argues that the coexistence of the pretzel croissant and Cronut is a form of competition, as both pastries cater to the trend of hybridized baked goods.\n\nMeanwhile, Dunkin' Donuts, a national chain, plans to launch its own croissant-doughnut hybrid, which they are calling the Croissant Donut, on November 3, 2014. Dunkin' Donuts emphasizes that they did not copy the Cronut and instead claims that their creation predates the Cronut.\n\nMaury Rubin's pretzel croissant and Dominique Ansel's Cronut represent the trend of hybrid pastries that have emerged in recent years. Ferran Adria, a molecular gastronomy chef, argues that innovation in baking has always involved combining and mutating existing ingredients and techniques. This trend is not new, but the popularity of the Cronut and other hybrid pastries has brought it to the forefront of the culinary world.\n\nThe success of these hybrid pastries can be attributed to their novelty and the appeal of combining two popular foods into one.

The review will focus on cases where the FBI's hair microscopy analysis was the sole or major evidence used to convict the defendants.\n\nThe investigation was prompted by a Washington Post report in April 2013, which revealed that the FBI had known for decades that its hair microscopy analysis was unreliable but continued to use it in criminal cases.

While Finding Dory and Finding Dory continued to perform well, The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG underperformed. The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Roald Dahl's classic children's book, brought in only $19.6 million in its opening weekend, significantly less than expected. The film, which cost $140 million to produce, has been criticized for its lackluster marketing and confusing target audience. Some believe that the film's failure may be due to the fact that it doesn't resonate with modern audiences, while others argue that it was simply overshadowed by stronger summer releases. The BFG tells the story of a young orphan named Sophie, who befriends a giant named BFG and embarks on an adventure to save Dream Country from the evil giants who steal children's dreams. Despite the disappointing box office performance, critics have praised the film for its visual effects and heartfelt storytelling. The BFG's poor performance at the box office may not be a reflection of Spielberg's abilities as a director, but rather the challenges of adapting a beloved children's book for a modern audience.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

The group's website offers detailed instructions on how to use misoprostol to induce an abortion, as well as counseling services and support.\n\nThe need for such a service arises from the fact that despite abortion being legal in the US, many women face significant barriers to accessing the procedure.

The drug is commonly used to prevent and treat ulcers, but it also has the ability to induce labor and cause the uterus to expel its contents. When used in combination with mifepristone, another abortion drug, misoprostol is an effective and safe method for early abortion.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that self-managed abortions carry risks, and women are advised to seek medical help if they experience heavy bleeding, severe cramping, or other complications.

The Department of the Interior, which oversees the Forest Service, has also faced criticism for its handling of sexual harassment and assault allegations.

Bernhardt resigned in December 2019 amidst reports that he had pressured a subordinate to drop a sexual harassment complaint against another employee.\n\nThe Forest Service and the Department of the Interior are not the only federal agencies facing allegations of sexual misconduct.

Tooke's retirement, which is effective immediately, comes just a few days after a PBS NewsHour investigation into both the Forest Service and Tooke, who informed his staff he'd be leaving in a Wednesday email obtained by Politico and BuzzFeed. While Tooke didn't confirm or deny the allegations against him—allegations that the New York Times says haven't yet been spelled out—he says, \"I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media,\" and therefore feels it's best to \"make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency.\" PBS talked to 34 current and former Forest Service female workers, who described a hostile work environment that included everything from bullying and sexual harassment to groping and rape. Many women also allege retaliation after they reported these incidents. The Forest Service says its parent agency, the Department of Agriculture, has \"engaged an independent investigator\" to look into specific allegations against Tooke, who has been with the Forest Service since he was 18. Tooke wrote in his email that \"I admire the courage\" of the women who've come forward about the Forest Service and that \"each employee deserves a leader who can maintain the proper moral authority to steer the Forest Service along this important and challenging course.\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue thanked Tooke in a statement for \"his decades of service to this nation and to the conservation of its natural resources.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 6723}

Multiple sources, including Fox News and Bloomberg, reported that Rice requested the unmasking of names in intelligence reports during the transition period between the Obama and Trump administrations. The unmasking was reportedly not related to any ongoing investigations or national security concerns, but rather for political reasons.\n\nThe revelation came after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) held a press conference to announce that he had seen intelligence reports that showed the identities of Trump team members were unmasked and disseminated to various government agencies. Nunes did not name Rice specifically, but sources later identified her as one of the officials who requested the unmasking.\n\nRice's actions have raised concerns about potential political targeting and civil liberties. The unmasking of U.S. citizens in intelligence reports is typically a rare occurrence and requires a valid reason. The Obama administration's use of this power during the transition period has sparked criticism and calls for an investigation.\n\nThe news of Rice's role in the unmasking came as a surprise, as she had previously denied any knowledge of surveillance of the Trump team. In an interview with MSNBC in March, Rice said, \"I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes this morning based on information that he got from sources.\"\n\nThe unmasking of Trump team members is just one of several investigations into potential surveillance and political targeting during the Obama administration. The FBI is currently investigating whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. The House Intelligence Committee is also investigating allegations of surveillance abuse and leaks of classified information.\n\nThe news of Rice's role in the unmasking has added fuel to the controversy surrounding the Obama administration's surveillance activities. The controversy has raised questions about the balance between national security and civil liberties, as well as the motivations behind the unmasking and dissemination of the identities of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe investigation into Rice's role in the unmasking is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what, if any, consequences she will face.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

The crisis began in 2009 when Greece's economy started to decline due to overspending and a large public debt. In 2010, the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided Greece with a bailout package worth €110 billion in exchange for implementing austerity measures. However, the measures led to widespread protests and economic hardship, and Greece missed several debt repayments, leading to its official default in June 2015.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on the latest bailout proposal from the EU and IMF, which included further austerity measures and privatization of state assets. Tsipras argued that the proposal was too harsh and would worsen the economic situation in Greece. The EU and IMF, on the other hand, argued that Greece needed to implement the reforms to secure further financial assistance and avoid defaulting on its debt.\n\nIn the lead-up to the referendum, there have been several developments. Greek banks have been closed since June 28, and capital controls have been imposed to prevent a run on the banks. The Greek government has also defaulted on a €1.5 billion IMF payment. Greek voters are being asked to vote \"yes\" if they accept the EU's bailout proposal and \"no\" if they reject it.\n\nThe outcome of the referendum is uncertain, and it could have significant implications for Greece and Europe.

However, they also have a historical background of practicing plural marriage, or polygamy, which was instituted through revelation in the early 1800s. Plural marriage was a significant aspect of Mormon history, with some practicing it openly in Utah between 1852 and 1890.\n\nThe origins of plural marriage can be traced back to biblical times, where some prophets were commanded by God to take multiple wives. In the early 1800s, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter-day Saints, received a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage. He married multiple women, including some who were already married, which caused controversy and led to persecution.\n\nPlural marriage was introduced to the Mormon community in the 1830s and 1840s. It was a challenging practice that tested the faith of many members. Some saw it as a way to increase the number of children and build strong families, while others saw it as a violation of God's commandment to love only one spouse.\n\nDespite the challenges, plural marriage was practiced by some Mormons for over 50 years. During this time, it led to the establishment of large Mormon communities in Utah and contributed to the growth of the Latter-day Saints Church. However, it also led to conflict with the US government, which saw polygamy as a violation of federal law.\n\nIn 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued a manifesto announcing the end of plural marriage. This decision was made in response to increasing pressure from the US government and society at large. Today, the Latter-day Saints no longer practice plural marriage and instead focus on monogamous marriage as the standard.\n\nDespite the historical significance of plural marriage, it remains a controversial topic.

Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

First, UCLA professor Bhagwan Chowdhry suggested that Satoshi could be Australian Craig Wright, who had been invited to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on cryptocurrency. However, Wright's nomination was later revealed to be a hoax due to a 50-year rule that prevents the disclosure of nominees' identities.\n\nDespite this setback, Wright gained renewed attention when Wired and Gizmodo reported that he was the likely creator of Bitcoin based on evidence including old blog posts, emails, and interviews with people who knew him in the early days of the cryptocurrency. The evidence suggested that Wright had the technical expertise and the motivation to create Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the reports also raised questions about the authenticity of the evidence and the possibility that Wright was attempting to manipulate the media to boost the price of Bitcoin. Wright has not yet publicly confirmed or denied the reports.\n\nThe Australian Taxation Office raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday in connection with a tax investigation, adding to the intrigue surrounding his identity. The raid did not provide any definitive answers, but it did fuel speculation that Wright was indeed Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in the world of technology and finance. The person or persons behind the pseudonym are believed to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin, worth billions of dollars, making the question of their identity a matter of great interest to the cryptocurrency community and beyond.\n\nIn other news, the price of Bitcoin continued to fluctuate, reaching a new all-time high of over $19,000 before dropping back down to around $16,000. The cryptocurrency's meteoric rise has attracted widespread attention and investment, but also concerns about its volatility and potential risks.\n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, have also seen significant gains in value, fueled by the broader trend towards decentralized digital currencies. However, they have also faced their own challenges, including regulatory uncertainty and concerns about security and scalability.\n\nOverall, the world of cryptocur", "answers": ["Wired says it has uncovered \"the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity.\" Nakamoto, the alias for the creator of Bitcoin, has never been unmasked publicly, but Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen name Australian Craig Wright, 44, as the most likely candidate. \"Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer,\" they write. Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million—the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor. Leaked transcripts from meetings with Wright's attorneys in February 2014 also quote him as saying: \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009 … By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.\" Then, in an odd interview at the Bitcoin Investor Conference, a moderator asked Wright how he first learned about Bitcoin. \"Um, I've been involved with all this for a long time,\" he said after a long pause. \"I—try and stay—I keep my head down.\" After sending an encrypted email to Wright suggesting he was Nakamoto, Wired received this response: \"You seem to know a few things.

The storm is expected to cost billions in damages and displace thousands of people. While the immediate focus is on rescue and relief efforts, the long-term implications of the storm are also being discussed, particularly in relation to climate change.\n\nScientists agree that climate change is making storms more intense and frequent, and Hurricane Harvey is no exception. According to several news reports, the storm dropped more rain in three days than Houston typically sees in an entire year. The record-breaking rainfall is a result of warmer ocean temperatures and other climate factors.\n\nDespite the scientific consensus, some politicians and media outlets have downplayed the role of climate change in the storm. For example, Fox News criticized CNN for bringing up climate change during their coverage of the storm, accusing them of using a crisis to advance a political agenda.\n\nHowever, the connection between climate change and extreme weather events is well-established in the scientific community. A recent study found that the likelihood of heavy rainfall events like Harvey has increased by 31% since the 1950s due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe cost of inaction on climate change is becoming increasingly clear, with billions of dollars in damages and human suffering resulting from extreme weather events. It is crucial that politicians and the media acknowledge the role of climate change in these events and take action to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, it is essential that we come together as a nation to support those affected by the storm and work towards a future where extreme weather events are not the new normal. This will require bold action on climate change and a commitment to building more resilient communities.", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The Obama administration had downplayed the significance of the prisoners being released, describing them as civilians and businessmen.

The Obama administration had reportedly agreed to the prisoner swap as part of the larger nuclear deal with Iran, which was also criticized for being too lenient on Iran.\n\nThe new information also raises questions about the extent to which the Obama administration was aware of the true nature of the prisoners being released. Some reports suggest that the administration had been briefed on the serious criminal charges against some of the prisoners but chose to downplay them in order to secure the deal.\n\nThe prisoner swap was also criticized for sending a message of weakness to Iran and other adversaries.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn’t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn’t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 9424}

The government plans to develop solar power projects in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, which was once a no-go area due to radiation. The land, which is still contaminated, is now being considered for solar farms as it receives more sunlight than other parts of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in Belarus, a 22.3 MW solar power plant is already operational near the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The plant, which was built in 2016, covers an area of 100 hectares and generates enough electricity to power 10,000 households.\n\nThe revival of these areas is not just limited to solar power. In Ukraine, there are plans to develop wind farms and biogas plants in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The Ukrainian government is also offering incentives to investors, such as tax exemptions and subsidies, to encourage investment in renewable energy projects.\n\nDespite the progress, challenges remain. The radiation levels in some areas of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are still too high for human habitation, and the decommissioning of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is expected to take several more decades. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure and the remote location of these areas make it difficult to transport and distribute the electricity generated from these renewable energy projects.\n\nThe people living near these sites continue to face stigma and discrimination, making it difficult for them to find employment and integrate into society. However, some are finding opportunities in the renewable energy sector. For instance, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone now attracts tourists, who come to see the abandoned buildings and explore the unique landscape. Local businesses have sprung up to cater to these tourists, providing them with food, accommodation, and souvenirs.\n\nThe revival of these areas is not just about economic opportunities", "answers": ["If anything, the land in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone left largely untouched since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is cheap.

Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills. Semerak says four energy companies from Canada and two investment firms from the US have expressed interest in a solar complex at the Chernobyl site, while Ukrainian developers intend to install panels there before 2016 is through.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere.

However, the Court struck down three other provisions of the law, finding that they interfered with federal immigration law. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer hailed the decision as a victory for her state, while President Barack Obama's administration criticized it as an unnecessary distraction from federal efforts to secure the border.\n\nIn the second case, the Court ruled that the Obama administration did not exceed its authority when it announced in 2012 that it would stop deporting and grant work permits to certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The administration's policy, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), was challenged by a group of states led by Texas. The Court found that the administration had the discretion to determine enforcement priorities and that DACA did not grant the recipients lawful status or create a right to remain in the United States.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion, criticized the majority for not going far enough in upholding Arizona's law and for not recognizing the constitutional limits on the federal government's power to regulate immigration.

He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move.

Zywicki, the judge determined that the texters knew or should have known that the driver was operating a vehicle at the time of their communication, and their texts constituted a breach of duty. This ruling is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nSimilarly, in New Jersey, a bill was introduced that would allow police to use a device called a \"textalyzer\" to determine if a driver was using their phone at the time of an accident. The device would be used to scan a phone for text messages, calls, and other data, potentially providing evidence of distracted driving.\n\nFurthermore, a study by the American Automobile Association (AAA) found that distracted driving caused about 3,166 deaths in 2014, with texting being a major contributor. The study also revealed that drivers under the age of 20 were the most likely to text and drive.\n\nIn response to the growing concern over distracted driving, some states have taken action to ban handheld devices while driving, and others have implemented texting bans for all drivers.\n\nMoreover, the use of social media apps while driving, such as Snapchat, has become a significant concern for safety advocates.In one case, a driver using the Snapchat filter \"Speed Filter\" while driving at over 100 miles per hour caused a fatal accident. The victim's family is now suing Snapchat for its role in the crash.\n\nThe legal landscape surrounding distracted driving is evolving, with potential liability extending beyond the driver to texters and even app developers.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, it is essential that drivers remain focused on the road and avoid distractions, including texting and using social media apps.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

The researchers, from King's College London, analyzed data from over 30,000 twins and found that boys with older fathers scored higher on a \"geek index\" that measured traits such as intelligence, creativity, and social awkwardness. The study also found that these sons tended to perform better academically and were more likely to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields).\n\nThe researchers suggest that this \"geek effect\" could be due to a number of factors, including the father's age at the time of conception, the father's genetic makeup, or environmental influences. They also note that the study has some limitations, including the fact that it relied on self-reported data and did not control for other factors that could influence son's outcomes, such as socioeconomic status or parenting style.\n\nThe study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that there are benefits to having older fathers, including increased intelligence and better health outcomes for their children. However, it also highlights the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of delaying fatherhood, such as the increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and other health issues.\n\nThe findings have sparked debate and excitement among scientists, parents, and the media. Some have hailed the study as evidence of the benefits of older fatherhood, while others have raised concerns about the potential risks and limitations of delaying parenthood. Some have even suggested that the study could have implications for efforts to increase diversity in STEM fields, as older fathers are more likely to have children later in life and may be more likely to pass on genes associated with these traits.\n\nOverall, the study provides intriguing insights into the complex relationship between father's age, genetics, and their children's development, and highlights the importance of continuing research in this area. It also underscores the need for a nuanced and balanced approach to understanding the risks and benefits of older fatherhood, and the importance of considering individual circumstances and contexts when making decisions about starting a family.", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs.

And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
