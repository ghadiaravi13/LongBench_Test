It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest.

The gender disparity in leadership roles persists, with women holding only 3.6% of Fortune 500 CEO positions. To address this issue, companies need to take action beyond a single day in April.\n\nFirst, introducing girls to female role models is crucial. Companies can bring their highest-ranking women to career days and highlight their achievements. Research shows that girls lack visible role models, and seeing successful women can inspire them to pursue leadership positions.\n\nSecond, girls need to understand what leadership entails. Companies should explain the responsibilities and rewards of leadership to girls from a young age. This understanding can help them make informed decisions about their careers and close the ambition gap.\n\nThird, proactive efforts are necessary to identify and groom female talent. Companies can support programs throughout the year that focus on developing women's leadership skills. These initiatives can include sponsorship programs, where executives use their political capital to advocate for women's advancement.\n\nPrinceton University took a similar approach when it found that female students were not winning top academic honors or holding visible leadership roles. The university implemented proactive measures, such as encouraging female students to apply for academic awards and creating sponsorship programs. These efforts led to a significant increase in the number of women receiving top honors.\n\nIn conclusion, it's time to take our daughters to the C-suite.

{"pred": "\n\nThe Pacific coast of North America hosts a diverse and thriving marine ecosystem, with Pacific sardines playing a crucial role as a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, and commercially important fish. However, the sardine population has experienced a significant decline, leading to concerns about the potential consequences for the ecosystem and the fishing industry. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has been urged to take action to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean by implementing conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing of forage fish.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is attributed to their naturally volatile nature and the impact of climate conditions. The Pacific sardine population has historically experienced significant fluctuations, with the current decline being the most severe in generations. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but some scientists believe that naturally occurring climate conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, may be contributing factors.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations has led to steep cuts in fishing quotas and concerns about the potential impact on the ecosystem and the fishing industry. The absence of sardines could lead to a shift in fishing pressure to other forage fish species, potentially disrupting the food chain and causing further harm to predators that rely on forage fish as a food source.\n\nThe value of forage fish, such as sardines, is not limited to their commercial value. They are worth significantly more when left in the water, as they provide food for larger predators and help maintain the overall health and productivity of the ocean. Forage fish are estimated to be worth over $10 billion when left in the water, compared to their commercial value of around $3 billion.\n\nThe Pacific sardine population has experienced significant declines before, with the last major collapse occurring in the 1950s. However, the current decline is raising concerns due to the lack of understanding of the underlying causes and the potential long-term consequences for the ecosystem and the fishing industry.\n\nThe PFMC is currently considering measures to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing of forage fish. These actions are intended to help ensure the long-term health and productivity of the Pacific Ocean and the species that depend on it.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

However, subsequent attempts to locate the snake failed, and it was assumed to be extinct or a labelling error.\n\nRecently, researchers Daniel Mulcahy from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Juan Martinez Gomez from Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find the elusive snake. They followed Beebe's original field notes and timed their expedition to replicate his steps. One of Martinez Gomez's graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot the snake in May 2021.\n\nDNA analysis confirmed that the snake was indeed the Clarion nightsnake and was genetically distinct from other snakes found in mainland Mexico. The researchers also discovered that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey from the mainland on a tree trunk that was washed out to sea.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is now recognized as a distinct species and is found exclusively on Clarion Island. Its rediscovery is significant because island ecosystems are fragile, and the loss of even one species can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. One such example is the Socorro dove, which went extinct in its natural habitat but was reintroduced to the islands.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake's rediscovery is a testament to the importance of historical data and museum collections in solving modern mysteries about biodiversity.

The second study, reported in The New York Times, revealed that for certain breast cancer patients, particularly those who receive chemotherapy and radiation, ALND may not be necessary at all.\n\nThe JAMA study, led by Dr. Monica Morrow, involved 898 women with early-stage breast cancer who were randomly assigned to either undergo ALND or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), a less invasive procedure that removes only the sentinel node, the first node that cancer is likely to spread to. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups.

Dallas County, which is home to Des Moines, is another important county to watch, as it is the largest and most populous in the state. Polk County, which includes Des Moines and is home to a large number of registered Republicans, is also expected to be a battleground.\n\nRick Santorum and Ron Paul are two underdog candidates who could potentially upset the race. Santorum, a social conservative, has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, particularly in Iowa and other Midwestern states. Paul, an anti-establishment candidate, has a strong following among libertarians and young voters.

Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul’s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney’s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames.

The virus was first identified in Germany in 1967, and since then, there have been sporadic outbreaks in Africa. The latest outbreak was confirmed in a 30-year-old Ugandan man who died of the disease on September 28, 2017. He had worked at a local health facility and is believed to have contracted the virus from a patient.\n\nThe Marburg virus is transmitted through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected people, or through contaminated surfaces and materials. The incubation period is between 2-21 days. The disease causes severe hemorrhagic symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and vomiting, followed by diarrhea, kidney failure, and in some cases, internal bleeding. The case fatality rate ranges from 24% to 88%.\n\nUpon confirmation of the case, the Ugandan Ministry of Health immediately put in place measures to contain the outbreak. Contact tracing was initiated, and all health workers who had come into contact with the patient were quarantined. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified, and international experts were deployed to assist in the response.\n\nThe Marburg virus has also been reported in South Africa and the Netherlands. In South Africa, a traveler from Uganda was diagnosed with the disease after arriving in the country. He had no symptoms during his travel, but developed them after arrival. He is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Johannesburg. In the Netherlands, a man who had recently traveled to Uganda was diagnosed with the disease. He is also receiving treatment in a hospital.\n\nThe Marburg virus is closely related to the Ebola virus, and both diseases are part of the Filoviridae family. The Marburg virus was first identified in Marburg, Germany, in 1967, during an outbreak that infected 31 people and killed 7.

The study, led by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 21,000 pregnancies and found that those who ate potatoes more frequently had a higher risk of gestational diabetes. The researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains could help lower this risk.\n\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. The condition is typically managed through diet and lifestyle changes, but in some cases, medication may be necessary.\n\nThe study did not prove causation, but the researchers suggest that potatoes have a high glycemic index, meaning they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Previous research has linked high glycemic index foods to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nThe study also noted that the UK's National Health Service currently advises that starchy foods, including potatoes, make up about a third of a person's daily food intake. However, the researchers emphasized the importance of consuming a variety of starchy foods and suggested that swapping potatoes for other options could help reduce the risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nThe study received mixed reactions from experts. Some praised the research for shedding light on the potential risks of potato consumption during pregnancy, while others cautioned against drawing definitive conclusions based on the study's findings alone.\n\nOverall, the study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that diet plays an important role in pregnancy health.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The reasons for the abandonment included unstable ice conditions, warmer temperatures, and overcrowding, which have contributed to a record number of deaths on the mountain this season.\n\nIn a separate incident, an avalanche struck a group of Sherpas, killing 16 and injuring several others. The tragedy marked the deadliest day in Everest's history and brought renewed attention to the risks and dangers faced by Sherpas, who make up a significant portion of the mountain's workforce. The incident also highlighted the need for better safety measures and compensation for Sherpas, who often bear the brunt of the risks and hazards associated with commercial mountaineering.\n\nThe growing popularity of Everest as a tourist destination has led to increased pressure on the mountain's resources and infrastructure.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The researchers found that men with longer faces, larger foreheads, and smaller jaws were perceived as more intelligent. However, no such correlation was found for women.

Much of this success can be attributed to the success of Disney's film studio, which has seen the success of films like \"The Avengers\" and \"Frozen,\" as well as the transformation of theme parks through immersive experiences based on these films. Disney CEO Robert Iger attributes the success to the company's ability to create compelling stories that resonate with audiences across multiple platforms.\n\nHowever, the success of major studios like Disney is leading to the disappearance of mid-budget films. John Waters, an independent filmmaker, recently lamented the lack of opportunities for filmmakers to make movies with budgets between $5 and $50 million. In the past, studios like Disney produced films in this range, but now, with the focus on blockbusters, these films are becoming increasingly rare.\n\nWaters' experience is not unique. Many filmmakers, including David Fincher and Steven Soderbergh, have expressed similar concerns about the lack of opportunities for mid-budget films. The shift towards blockbusters is due in part to the increasing costs of marketing and distributing films. Studios now spend as much as 50% of a film's budget on marketing and distribution, making it difficult to justify investing in smaller films.\n\nThe impact of this trend is felt not only by filmmakers but also by audiences. Mid-budget films often offer unique perspectives and stories that don't fit neatly into the blockbuster mold. The loss of these films means a loss of diversity in the film industry.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are signs of hope. Streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are investing in original content, including films, and are willing to take risks on mid-budget projects. Additionally, some independent filmmakers are finding success through crowdfunding and other alternative financing methods.\n\nIn conclusion, the success of major studios like Disney is leading to a decline in mid-budget films, which is having a negative impact on both filmmakers and audiences.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

In her resignation letter, Downing expressed her frustration with the city council's lack of action to address the housing crisis and the negative impact it has on the community. She noted that teachers, firefighters, and other essential workers are also being priced out of the area, leading to a shortage of essential services.\n\nDowning is not alone in her concerns. A recent survey conducted by the Palo Alto Weekly found that housing affordability was the top issue for residents. The survey revealed that over 70% of respondents believed that the city should prioritize building more housing units to address the affordability crisis. However, the city has been slow to act, with many residents and city council members expressing concerns about overdevelopment and preserving the character of the community.\n\nThe lack of affordable housing is not unique to Palo Alto. Across the Bay Area, the high cost of living is driving out working-class residents, leading to a mass exodus from the region. The situation has become so dire that some cities, such as Menlo Park, have seen a net loss of residents in recent years.\n\nThe housing crisis in the Bay Area is not just an issue for individuals and families; it also has broader economic implications. The shortage of affordable housing is making it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees, leading to a shortage of skilled labor and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, the high cost of living is making it difficult for young people to start businesses and contribute to the local economy.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some signs of progress. Some cities, such as San Jose, are taking steps to address the housing crisis by increasing the density of housing developments and implementing inclusionary zoning policies.

Astronomers have used data from 19 galaxies to determine the universe's expansion rate, which is now estimated to be 73.5 kilometers per second per megaparsec, up from the previous estimate of 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This discrepancy could be due to inaccuracies in the measurements or new physics yet to be discovered.\n\nThe new findings could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. One possibility is that there is a new form of dark energy or a modification to Einstein's theory of general relativity. Another possibility is that there are errors in the measurements or assumptions made in previous studies.\n\nThe researchers believe that the new data could help resolve long-standing mysteries in cosmology, such as the Hubble constant controversy and the nature of dark energy. They plan to continue observing and analyzing data to refine their estimates and better understand the universe's expansion.\n\nThe discovery also raises questions about the fundamental nature of space and time. If the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, it could mean that the fabric of space itself is changing, with implications for the behavior of matter and energy at large scales.\n\nThe new findings have been met with excitement and skepticism in the scientific community. Some researchers have expressed caution about the implications of the results and the need for further confirmation. Others have hailed the discovery as a major breakthrough that could help answer some of the most profound questions about the universe.\n\nOverall, the new measurements of the universe's expansion rate are a significant development in cosmology, with potential implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of space and time.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

Both pastries have gained significant popularity and have even inspired copycats.\n\nDunkin' Donuts, a national chain, has entered the scene with its own version of the croissant-doughnut hybrid, which it calls the \"Croissant Donut.\" However, Dunkin' Donuts has distanced itself from the Cronut name, as Dominique Ansel has trademarked the term.\n\nThe trend of hybrid pastries is not new, as stale bread is often used to create new sweets. Ferran Adria, a molecular gastronomy chef, argues that innovation in pastry begins in the kitchen before the baking process. He believes that the fusion of different pastries is a natural evolution in the baking industry.\n\nDominique Ansel's Cronut became a viral sensation, with people lining up hours before the bakery opened to get their hands on one.

The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg, brought in only $19.6 million in its opening weekend, making it a significant flop. The film, based on Roald Dahl's classic children's book, cost $140 million to produce and market. Critics praised the visual effects and Mark Rylance's performance, but audiences were not as impressed. The film's poor performance has raised questions about the appeal of Roald Dahl's stories to modern audiences and whether Spielberg's touch is no longer enough to guarantee box office success. The BFG tells the story of a young orphan named Sophie who befriends a giant named BFG. The film also stars Ruby Barnhill, Mark Rylance, and Penelope Wilton. Despite the disappointing box office numbers, some critics have defended the film, arguing that it is not a complete failure and that its modest budget may ultimately make it profitable.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

She was sold to Chinese men who demanded sexual favors in exchange for money. Suh's story is one of many among the thousands of North Korean women who have been trafficked into China and forced into sexual slavery.\n\nThe women are often lured into China with false promises of employment or marriage.

Several corporations, including Walmart and Ford, demanded that Hyde-Smith return their campaign donations in response to her comment. Hyde-Smith later apologized for the comment, stating that she was using an \"exaggerated expression of regard\" and that she meant no offense.\n\nAnother controversy arose when Hyde-Smith was seen in a video joking about suppressing liberal votes at a college campus.

However, they also have a historical background of practicing plural marriage, or polygamy, which was instituted through a revelation given to Joseph Smith in the 1830s and 1840s. Plural marriage was a challenging aspect of the Restoration, as it went against the cultural norms of the time and faced significant opposition.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced through a series of revelations, starting in the late 1820s and continuing into the 1840s. These revelations commanded Joseph Smith to enter into plural marriages, which he did, resulting in him having multiple wives. The practice was not widely known or accepted during Smith's lifetime, but it became more public after his death.\n\nPlural marriage was based on the belief that it was a commandment from God to increase the number of children in the Church and to provide for the spiritual and temporal needs of widows and orphans. It was also seen as a way to build a more perfect society and to prepare for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nDespite the challenges and controversies surrounding plural marriage, it had a significant impact on Mormon society. It shaped the development of Mormon communities in Utah and contributed to the growth of the Church. Plural marriage also influenced Mormon theology and continues to be a topic of interest and study among scholars and Church members.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was officially discontinued in 1890, following the manifesto issued by Church President Wilford Woodruff. The Church now teaches and practices monogamous marriage as the standard for its members. However, the historical significance of plural marriage continues to be recognized and studied within the Church.\n\nThe introduction and practice of plural marriage was a complex and controversial aspect of Mormon history.

The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

Wright (1977), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporal punishment, or the use of physical force as a disciplinary measure, in public schools does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment or the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that the history and tradition of corporal punishment in schools, as well as the community's involvement in school affairs, provide sufficient safeguards against excessive or abusive use of force.\n\nHowever, in recent years, concerns have been raised about the use of corporal punishment in schools, particularly in light of research suggesting that it may be ineffective and even harmful to children. For instance, a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that in Alabama during the 2013-2014 school year, boys were paddled at a rate of 11.2 times per 1,000 students, while girls were paddled at a rate of 4.2 times per 1,000 students. The study also found that black students were paddled at a higher rate than their white counterparts.\n\nFurthermore, a resolution passed by the American Psychological Association in 1975 opposes the use of corporal punishment in all institutions where children are cared for, including schools, juvenile facilities, and childcare centers. The resolution cites research showing that corporal punishment can have negative effects on children, such as lowering self-esteem, increasing aggression, and undermining the development of effective problem-solving skills.\n\nDespite these concerns, corporal punishment remains a common disciplinary practice in many schools across the United States. For example, in Alabama, 96% of public schools reported using corporal punishment during the 2013-2014 school year. In some districts, such as Lowndes County, corporal punishment is the most common form of discipline, accounting for over 70% of all disciplinary actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Supreme Court has upheld the use of corporal punishment in schools, concerns about its effectiveness and potential harm to children have led to calls for its abolition. The American Psychological Association, among other organizations, has taken a stance against corporal punishment, citing research showing its negative effects.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

Hanson had connections to Mexican drug cartels and was a key player in the illegal gambling industry in the United States and Australia.\n\nThe investigation led to the arrest of several members of Hanson's organization, including his brother, Michael Hanson, and his associate, Jason Owen Hanson. Michael Hanson was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and Jason Owen Hanson was sentenced to 12 years. Hanson himself was arrested in Mexico in 2016 and extradited to the United States. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison in December 2017.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that Hanson had used Cipriani to launder money through his gambling activities.

The 35-year-old California man was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison Friday after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs, reports the Washington Post. His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets. More than 20 of Hanson's associates have also been charged with crimes related to gambling and drug trafficking."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10635}

Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, is credited with predicting the existence of solar wind in the 1950s. The mission, which is set to launch in summer 2018, will travel closer to the sun than any spacecraft before it, providing unprecedented data on solar activity and solar wind. The probe will investigate the sun's outer layer, known as the corona, and its interaction with the solar wind and magnetic fields. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy from the sun to Earth, studying the solar wind's acceleration mechanism, and understanding the causes of space weather. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its effects on the solar system. NASA has never named a mission after a living scientist before, making this a historic moment for the agency and for Parker. The mission's budget is $1.5 billion, and it is scheduled to make 24 close passes by the sun over the course of its seven-year mission. The probe will be protected by a heat shield that can withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission's principal investigator is Stuart Bale of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter mission, which is also studying the sun, is expected to launch in 2020.

The cause of their deaths has long been a mystery, with theories ranging from suffocation to drowning to explosion. In a new study published in the journal Plos One, researchers suggest that the crew may have been killed instantly by a shockwave caused by the submarine's own torpedo, which detonated prematurely upon contact with the ocean floor.\n\nThe Hunley was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship in combat, but it met its end just days after its successful attack on the USS Housatonic. The crew was presumed dead, but their bodies were not found until 2000, when the submarine was raised from the ocean floor.\n\nThe new theory was inspired by experiments conducted by biomechanical engineer Rachel Lance, who was investigating the possibility of the crew suffocating in the confined space of the submarine. However, her research led her to question the suffocation theory and instead focus on the possibility of a shockwave causing the crew's deaths.\n\nLance conducted experiments using a model of the Hunley and a torpedo, and found that the torpedo's detonation caused a shockwave that would have been strong enough to kill the crew instantly. She also found that the crew's bodies, which were found in a seated position with their hands on their heads, were likely caused by the shockwave forcing their bodies into that position.\n\nThe findings have not been universally accepted, however, with some experts questioning the validity of the experiments and the conclusions drawn from them. The Hunley Conservancy, which is responsible for the preservation and study of the submarine, declined to comment on the study.\n\nThe mystery of the Hunley's crew deaths remains unsolved, but Lance's research offers a new theory that could help explain what happened.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

The proposal has gained momentum within the Democratic Party, with several potential 2020 presidential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand, expressing their support for the idea. The bill, which is unlikely to pass in the current political climate, is seen as a way to push the healthcare debate further to the left and put pressure on other Democrats to take a stronger stance on the issue.\n\nThe Medicare for All bill would replace the current employer-based healthcare system with a single-payer system, funded by taxes. The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism, with some arguing that it would lead to better healthcare outcomes and reduced costs, while others express concerns about the potential financial burden and the feasibility of implementing such a large-scale reform.\n\nThe idea of Medicare for All has gained popularity among Democrats in recent years, with a growing number of Americans expressing support for the concept. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 56% of Americans favor a national healthcare program in which all Americans are covered, while 42% oppose it. The issue is expected to be a major point of contention in the upcoming 2020 presidential race.\n\nSanders' bill is expected to be introduced alongside a companion bill in the House of Representatives, which will be led by Representative Pramila Jayapal. The bill is expected to include provisions for dental, vision, and reproductive healthcare, as well as prescription drug coverage.\n\nDespite the political challenges, Sanders and his supporters remain optimistic about the prospects of passing the bill, arguing that the growing support for Medicare for All among Democrats and the American public will eventually lead to its implementation. Sanders has also indicated that he plans to travel across the country to build support for the bill and engage with voters on the issue.\n\nThe Medicare for All proposal is just one of several healthcare-related initiatives that Sanders and other Democrats have put forward in recent months.

Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

Wolff's book, \"Fire and Fury,\" has been a bestseller since its release.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been much interest in Pence's relationship with his wife, Karen, and their marriage. Pence has been known for his traditional values and has maintained a strong bond with his wife throughout his political career. In 2013, when Pence was still governor of Indiana, he faced criticism for his handling of a religious freedom bill. During this time, Pence's staff reportedly tried to prevent him from attending a Broadway show, \"Aladdin,\" due to its portrayal of homosexuality. Pence's staff also reportedly tried to prevent a needle exchange program from being implemented in Scott County, Indiana, which was experiencing a HIV outbreak.\n\nDespite these controversies, Pence's popularity among conservative voters has remained strong. In 2016, Trump selected Pence as his running mate, and the ticket went on to win the election. Since then, Pence has been a key figure in the Trump administration, particularly on social issues. He has been a vocal advocate for traditional marriage and has worked to roll back Obama-era policies on issues such as transgender rights and abortion.\n\nHowever, Pence's record on other issues has been less consistent. For example, during his time as governor of Indiana, he supported Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, but later reversed his position and refused to expand Medicaid under the Trump administration. Pence has also faced criticism for his handling of the opioid crisis in Indiana, which has been particularly severe in Scott County.\n\nDespite these challenges, Pence remains a popular figure among conservative voters, and many see him as a potential contender for the presidency in the future.

{"pred": "\n\nTexting while driving has long been a safety concern, but a recent legal development in Pennsylvania could hold texters liable for distracting others behind the wheel. In a case of first impression, Judge John T. McFadden ruled that two men could be sued for texting the driver of a car that caused a fatal accident. The judge's decision follows a similar ruling in New Jersey in 2016, which found that a driver's texting conversation with another person could constitute negligence.\n\nThe Pennsylvania case involves a driver who was texting with two friends when he crashed into another vehicle, killing the driver and injuring two passengers. The victims' families are now suing the two texters for their role in the accident. The defendants argue that they were not directly responsible for the crash and that Pennsylvania law does not hold remote texters liable for accidents caused by distracted drivers.\n\nHowever, Judge McFadden disagreed, stating that the texters' actions could be considered a breach of duty of care. The judge noted that the texters knew the driver was operating a vehicle and that their messages could distract him from the road. The ruling could set a precedent for future cases involving texting and driving accidents.\n\nMeanwhile, in New Jersey, a similar case is making its way through the courts. A man is suing his friend for texting him just before the friend caused a car accident. The plaintiff argues that the text message caused his friend to take his eyes off the road and crash into his vehicle. The case is currently in the discovery phase, with both sides exchanging evidence and information.\n\nThe legal developments come as distracted driving continues to be a major cause of accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,142 people were killed in distracted driving crashes in 2019. Texting and driving is particularly dangerous, as it requires drivers to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the wheel, and their focus away from the task of driving.\n\nIn response to the growing concern over distracted driving, some states have implemented textalyzer technology, which allows law enforcement to determine if a driver was using their phone at the time of an accident. The technology is currently being challenged in court, with some arguing that it violates privacy rights.\n\nThe legal developments could have significant implications for texting and driving", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

The storm was so large that it caused power outages in Georgia as well.\n\nThe Internet Archive announced that it is working to fix all broken links on the web by archiving web pages as they are created and preserving them for future use. This will help ensure that links to important information remain functional, even if the original webpage is taken down or changed.\n\nIn other news, the Internet Archive also announced that it had successfully archived all of the pages on the deep web, which are not indexed by search engines. This is a significant achievement, as the deep web contains a vast amount of information that is not readily accessible to the general public.\n\nThe storm caused widespread destruction and displacement, with millions of people affected. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but it is clear that the recovery effort will be long and costly. The storm also highlighted the importance of preparedness and the need for effective disaster response and recovery efforts.\n\nThe Internet Archive's efforts to preserve web pages and make them accessible to the public are an important step in ensuring that valuable information is not lost and that the web remains a valuable resource for learning and research. The successful archiving of the deep web is a major milestone in this effort, and it will help ensure that important information remains accessible to future generations.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by Hurricane Irma, there are reasons for hope. The resilience of the people of Florida and the resources of the government and the private sector are being mobilized to help those affected by the storm.

No. 2 came at 3:35pm at Marco Island, about 15 miles from Naples, while Irma was a Category 3 storm, per the Guardian. As of 5pm, it had been downgraded to a Category 2, though winds were still a powerful 110mph. That is technically below \"major hurricane\" status, notes the AP, though the distinction may be small comfort to cities along its path. Perhaps the biggest concern continues to be the densely populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area, thought to be \"woefully ill-equipped\" to handle such a big storm, per the Washington Post. Irma should arrive there after midnight. “Today is going to the be the long day,” says Mark DeMaria of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Though Miami avoided a direct hit, the driving rain and storm surges have flooded parts of the downtown area, particularly the Brickell neighborhood. And two construction cranes have collapsed onto buildings in Miami, though no casualties were reported. In Palm Bay, also on the east coast, a related tornado destroyed six mobile homes, reports USA Today. Irma is on track to hit Georgia Monday morning, and a state of emergency was in effect for all 159 counties. On Sunday morning, Irma made its first landfall at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11899}
