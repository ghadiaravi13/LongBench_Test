The publication, which has been a leader in the sexual revolution since its inception in 1953, will no longer feature nude photographs in its print edition starting March 2016.

The rise of the internet and free adult content has made it difficult for print publications to compete.\n\nPlayboy is not the only publication to make such a move. Other magazines, such as Esquire and GQ, have also shifted their focus away from nudity and towards more serious content. However, Playboy's decision is particularly significant because of the magazine's history and its association with sexual liberation.\n\nThe move has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the decision as a step towards normalizing nudity and reducing the stigma surrounding sexuality. Others have criticized it as a sellout and a betrayal of the magazine's core values.\n\nDespite the controversy, Playboy's decision to remove nudity from its print edition is likely to be a smart business move.

The move also allows Playboy to focus on its other ventures, such as its television and licensing deals.\n\nIn conclusion, Playboy's decision to remove nudity from its print edition is a significant shift for the iconic magazine.

The site, located in the high desert of eastern Oregon, was announced by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Thursday. The findings include stone tools and animal bones, which have been sent to a laboratory for further analysis.\n\nThe site, which is outside of the town of Grants Pass, was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by Scott Williams, a research associate at the University of Oregon. The team has been working in the area for several years, and this latest discovery is particularly significant because of the age of the artifacts.\n\nThe oldest artifacts found at the site are flint tools, which were likely used for hunting and butchering animals. The team also found evidence of hearths and charcoal, suggesting that the site was used for cooking and warmth.\n\nThe discovery is exciting for archaeologists because it challenges the current understanding of when humans first arrived in North America. The previous oldest known site in the region is the Clovis site in New Mexico, which is around 13,000 years old.\n\nThe team is still in the early stages of excavation, and further analysis will be needed to determine the exact age of the site and the culture of the people who lived there. The site is being carefully preserved, and the public is being asked to stay away to avoid damaging the fragile artifacts.\n\nThe discovery of the site is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the study of human history in North America. It could provide new insights into the early development of human societies and their adaptation to the new world.\n\nThe team of archaeologists is being led by Dr. Patrick Frazier of the University of Oregon.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) recently reported that Pacific sardines have dropped to their lowest levels since 1950, and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) warned that the West Coast's fisheries could collapse if urgent action is not taken.\n\nOne of the primary causes of this crisis is the decline in the Pacific sardine population, which serves as a critical food source for many marine species, including seabirds, sea otters, and salmon. The PFMC attributed the decline to a combination of factors, including overfishing, climate change, and ocean warming.\n\nThe Pacific sardine population is not the only one in trouble. The Pacific herring population, another important forage fish, has also declined significantly. The PFMC reported that Pacific herring populations have declined by up to 90% in some areas.\n\nThe decline in forage fish populations is having a ripple effect on the entire marine ecosystem. For example, the decline in sardines and herring is affecting the populations of predators, such as seabirds, sea otters, and marine mammals. The decline in seabird populations, in particular, is a cause for concern as they are important indicators of the health of the marine ecosystem.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts, an environmental organization, has called for urgent action to address the crisis. The organization is urging the Pew West Coast Governors to take steps to rebuild the forage fish populations and protect the marine ecosystem. The Pew Charitable Trusts is also advocating for the establishment of a network of marine protected areas to help restore the health of the West Coast marine ecosystem.\n\nThe crisis is not just an environmental issue. It also has economic implications. The West Coast fishing industry relies heavily on forage fish as a food source for larger commercial fish, such as salmon and rockfish.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study, which compares individuals who have adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet with those who have not, offers insights into the motivations and challenges of those who have made the switch.\n\nAccording to the study, approximately 2% of the US population identifies as vegetarian or vegan, with the majority of these individuals being women. The study also found that while there are various reasons why people choose to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, the most common motivators are ethical concerns, health benefits, and environmental sustainability.\n\nOne interesting finding from the study is that while many people express a desire to reduce their meat consumption for ethical reasons, they often face challenges in implementing this change. For example, some people may find it difficult to obtain enough protein or iron in their diet without consuming meat. Others may face social pressure to eat meat or may find it difficult to eat out at restaurants.\n\nDespite these challenges, the study found that those who have successfully adopted a vegetarian or vegan diet report numerous benefits, including improved health, increased energy levels, and a reduced carbon footprint. The study also found that those who have made the switch are more likely to be involved in animal advocacy and to support animal welfare organizations.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of social support in helping individuals make the transition to a vegetarian or vegan diet.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, aimed to estimate the number and rate of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in outpatient settings and to assess the proportion of prescriptions that were likely to be unnecessary.\n\nThe study used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to identify ARI visits and antibiotic prescriptions. The researchers found that there were approximately 136 million ARI visits in outpatient settings, resulting in 111 million antibiotic prescriptions. Of these prescriptions, an estimated 28% were deemed unnecessary based on clinical guidelines.\n\nThe study also found that the rate of antibiotic prescribing varied widely by age group, with children under 18 years old being the most likely to receive antibiotics for ARIs. The researchers noted that this may be due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of ARIs in children, as well as parental pressure and concerns about missing a bacterial infection.\n\nThe authors of the study emphasized the importance of reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing to help combat antibiotic resistance and promote the appropriate use of these important medications. They called for increased education and training for healthcare providers, as well as the development and implementation of clinical decision support tools to help guide prescribing decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, the study found that approximately one in three antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory infections in outpatient settings were unnecessary based on clinical guidelines.

Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal.

In addition, the unemployment insurance system itself is on the brink of insolvency, with 31 states reporting trust fund shortfalls and 13 states having exhausted their funds.\n\nOne major cause of the unemployment crisis is the recession, which has led to a significant increase in unemployment claims. However, another factor is the high cost of unemployment insurance, which has risen sharply in recent years. In some states, the cost of unemployment insurance has more than doubled since 2003.\n\nTo make matters worse, many states are facing budget crises, which has led to cuts in unemployment benefits and other social services. Thirty-three states have already made cuts to unemployment benefits, and more cuts are expected in the coming months.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for long-term unemployed workers, who are facing the prospect of losing their benefits altogether. In some states, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits has been reduced from 26 weeks to as little as 13 weeks.\n\nTo make matters worse, some small business owners are facing significant increases in unemployment taxes, which can make it more difficult for them to hire new workers. In some cases, these taxes can amount to as much as 6.2% of an employee's wages.\n\nAt the federal level, there are signs that policymakers may be taking action to address the unemployment crisis. President Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that includes an extension of unemployment benefits and funding for state and local governments to prevent layoffs. However, it remains to be seen whether this proposal will be passed by Congress.\n\nIn the meantime, many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, with unemployment rates remaining high and job growth slow. The situation is particularly dire for low-wage workers, who are often the first to be laid off during economic downturns and the last to be hired back during recoveries.\n\nOverall, the unemployment crisis is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted solution.

{"pred": "\n\nA rare discovery was made on a remote Mexican island when researchers rediscovered the Clarke's Rail, a species of snake-necked bird that was believed to be extinct for almost 80 years. The Clarke's Rail was first discovered in 1938 on the Isla de Clarke, but due to habitat loss and predation, it was thought to have vanished. However, a team of scientists led by Daniel Lebbin from the University of California, Berkeley, and Juan Carlos Garcia from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, found evidence of the bird's existence during a recent expedition.\n\nThe team's findings were published in the journal Avian Conservation and Ecology. They discovered that the Clarke's Rail population had been hiding in a remote and inaccessible area of the island, which had been previously overlooked. The researchers were able to capture several individuals and study their behavior and habitat requirements.\n\nThe discovery of the Clarke's Rail is a significant achievement for conservation efforts in Mexico. The team's findings will help inform future conservation strategies to protect the species and its habitat. The researchers are currently working with local communities and government agencies to develop a plan to preserve the bird's population and prevent further habitat loss.\n\nMeanwhile, on another island, a team of researchers led by Dr. James Parr from the University of California, Berkeley, made a surprising discovery of their own. They found that a species of snake, the Boa constrictor, had evolved to have a unique coloration that mimicked the leaves of the trees it lived in. This adaptation helps the snake blend in with its surroundings and avoid detection by predators and prey.\n\nThe researchers believe that this coloration is a relatively recent evolutionary development, as the snakes on the island have only been isolated from their mainland counterparts for around 10,000 years. The team plans to further study the snake's behavior and genetics to better understand the evolutionary pressures that led to this adaptation.\n\nThese discoveries highlight the importance of continued research and exploration in the natural world. They also underscore the need for conservation efforts to protect endangered species and their habitats.

According to recent reports, there are several key things to watch for on caucus night.\n\nFirst, the performance of the top-tier candidates, including Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, and Newt Gingrich, will be closely monitored. Romney, the current frontrunner, is expected to perform well due to his strong organization and financial resources. However, Santorum has gained momentum in recent weeks, particularly in the final days of the campaign. Paul and Gingrich are also expected to have a strong showing.\n\nSecond, the turnout and organization of the caucus process itself will be crucial. Iowa's caucus system is unique and complex, and any issues with the process could potentially disrupt the results.\n\nThird, the impact of negative ads and last-minute endorsements could also play a role in the outcome. In recent weeks, negative ads have dominated the airwaves, and some candidates have accused others of running misleading or false ads. Additionally, several high-profile endorsements have been made in the final days of the campaign.\n\nFinally, the results of the Iowa caucus will set the stage for the upcoming primaries in New Hampshire and beyond. The winner of the Iowa caucus is often seen as having momentum heading into the next contest, and a strong showing in Iowa could help a candidate gain momentum and build support in other states.\n\nAs the caucus night approaches, all eyes will be on Iowa to see which candidate will emerge as the frontrunner in the GOP race for the presidency. The results are expected to be announced on Tuesday, January 3, 2012.", "answers": ["Tonight’s the night! At 7pm CT, Iowa Republicans will gather to cast the first votes in the Republican nominating season. Consider this your pregame report, with info from Politico, Mother Jones, and the Des Moines Register: The frontrunners: Polls show Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum are poised to grab the proverbial “three tickets out of Iowa.” Romney doesn’t need to win to remain the favorite for the nomination, but anything less than a respectable second will be damaging. Turnout is everything: If it’s high, that’s probably a good sign for Romney. If it’s low, it’s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum—depending on where it’s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul’s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney’s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And Santorum appeared with the cast of 19 Kids and Counting, the TLC reality show beloved by Iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: Paul’s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76% of Santorum’s supporters say they’ll definitely caucus for him. Romney, meanwhile, has at some point trailed five different candidates in Iowa—and is now polling at exactly the same 18% he was at in January."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4291}

The study, published in the journal BMJ Nutrition Prevention & Health, analyzed data from over 12,000 pregnant women in the United States and found that those who consumed more potatoes, especially fried or processed varieties, had a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. The researchers noted that the starch in potatoes can raise blood sugar levels, and frying or processing can increase the glycemic index of the food. However, the study did not find a link between potato consumption and type 2 diabetes or other health issues. The American Diabetes Association recommends limiting starchy foods, including potatoes, to one serving per meal for people with diabetes.\n\nIn other news, a group of scientists has discovered a new species of shark in the Pacific Ocean. The shark, named Carcharhinus melanopterus, is a small, blacktip shark with distinctive markings on its fins. The researchers believe that the shark may be a new subspecies of the common blacktip shark, but more research is needed to confirm its taxonomic status. The discovery was made during a research expedition to the Pacific Ocean, and the scientists are hoping to learn more about the shark's behavior, habitat, and population size.\n\nA team of researchers has developed a new material that could help reduce the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The research, led by neuroscientist Elseline Hoekstra at Radboud University in the Netherlands, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan the brains of 23 first-time mothers before and after pregnancy. The results showed that the volume of gray matter in several brain regions increased during pregnancy, while the volume of white matter decreased. These changes were most pronounced in areas related to emotion regulation, memory, and social cognition.\n\nThe study also found that the functional connectivity between different brain regions changed during pregnancy. Specifically, there was increased connectivity between the amygdala, which is involved in processing emotions, and the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for regulating emotions. This finding suggests that the brain adaptations during pregnancy may help mothers better respond to their infants' emotional needs.\n\nThe researchers also found that these brain changes were associated with improvements in maternal sensitivity, which is the ability to appropriately respond to an infant's emotional signals. Mothers who showed greater increases in gray matter volume and functional connectivity in certain brain regions were more sensitive to their infants' needs and displayed more positive interactions with them.\n\nThe study provides important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying maternal behavior and the ways in which the brain adapts to the demands of motherhood. The findings could also have implications for the treatment of mental health conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth, such as postpartum depression and anxiety.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups.

This finding challenges the current understanding of the universe, which assumes that the expansion is decelerating due to the effects of gravity.\n\nThe researchers used observations of distant supernovae to measure the rate of expansion. They found that the universe is expanding at a rate of 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This is faster than the previous estimate of 71 kilometers per second per megaparsec.\n\nThe team also found that the universe's expansion is being driven by a mysterious force known as dark energy. Dark energy is thought to make up around 68% of the universe, and its exact nature is still not fully understood.\n\nThe new findings could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. They suggest that the expansion of the universe may be entering a new phase, in which the rate of expansion continues to accelerate indefinitely.\n\nThe researchers also noted that their findings are consistent with the theory of cosmic inflation, which suggests that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.\n\nThe team plans to continue studying the expansion of the universe to better understand the nature of dark energy and the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nIn related news, a separate study published in the journal Nature Astronomy found that the universe is not perfectly symmetrical, as previously thought.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl.

The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies.

But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

However, the Court ruled that the use of corporal punishment in schools did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as long as it did not inflict unnecessary suffering or shock the conscience.\n\nIn a separate news item, it is reported that in 1973, a federal district court in Alabama ruled that corporal punishment in public schools was unconstitutional. However, this ruling was later overturned by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 1976.\n\nIn the third news article, it is mentioned that in 1976, the American Psychological Association (APA) adopted a resolution opposing corporal punishment in schools.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist?

The city's flooding was exacerbated by the failure of the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, which were designed to protect the city from flooding. The breaches caused by the storm led to the release of billions of gallons of water into the city, causing widespread damage.\n\nThe storm also highlighted the importance of community resilience and the role of volunteers in disaster response. Neighbors came together to help each other, and organizations from across the country sent aid and resources to the affected areas.\n\nHowever, the recovery process is expected to be long and challenging.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

He also questions the handling of evidence and the interpretation of key findings by the original investigators.\n\nMeanwhile, in a related development, a Colorado grand jury has indicted John Mark Karr, a former school teacher, on charges of first-degree murder, sexual assault, and kidnapping in connection with the JonBenét Ramsey case. Karr, who was arrested in California in 2006, has long been a person of interest in the investigation, but there was never enough evidence to bring charges against him. The new indictment comes after a recent DNA test linked Karr's DNA to a semen sample found on JonBenét's underwear.

A previous investigation by the two news outlets suggested that former District Attorney Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. Lacy concluded that those tests revealed that an intruder killed the girl, but outside forensic experts have since disputed that, asserting that the DNA was a mishmash of multiple people and not that of the single person referred to as \"Unknown Male 1.\" \"If you're looking for someone that doesn't exist, because actually it's several people, it's a problem,\" explained a former US attorney for Colorado.

After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA.

The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub.

The incident also highlighted the need for greater transparency and control over personal data on social media platforms.\n\nMeanwhile, another privacy issue emerged when it was reported that a popular Android app called \"Brightest Flashlight\" was secretly collecting and sharing users' location data with third-party advertisers. The app, which claimed to function as a flashlight, was downloaded millions of times and generated revenue through targeted ads based on users' location data.\n\nIn response to these privacy concerns, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it had sent letters to 11 popular mobile app developers, warning them to be transparent about their data collection and sharing practices. The FTC also reminded app developers that they must obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and sharing sensitive information, such as location data.\n\nThe privacy issues highlighted the need for greater transparency and control over personal data on digital platforms. Many users expressed frustration and concern about the amount of data being collected and shared without their knowledge or consent. The incidents also underscored the importance of reading app permissions carefully and being vigilant about the data that is being collected and shared.\n\nIn the wake of these privacy concerns, some tech companies and industry groups have called for greater regulation of data collection and usage. Others argue that self-regulation and user education are more effective solutions. Regardless of the approach, it is clear that privacy will continue to be a major issue in the digital age", "answers": ["Talk about being too good at your non-job. A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site.

{"pred": "\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders' former presidential campaigner, Bernie Sanders, is once again making headlines with his healthcare proposal. In a bid to address the rising healthcare costs and ensure universal coverage, Sanders plans to introduce a new bill in the Senate, titled \"Medicare for All.\" The bill, which has already gained support from several Democratic senators, aims to provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to every American, regardless of their income or employment status.\n\nThe proposal comes at a time when healthcare costs continue to be a major concern for many Americans. According to a recent study, healthcare costs have risen by an average of 3.2% per year since 2012, outpacing inflation and wage growth. This has resulted in many Americans struggling to afford their medical bills, leading to a growing call for affordable healthcare solutions.\n\nSanders' Medicare for All bill is not a new idea. He first introduced the bill in 2017, but it failed to gain enough support in the Senate. However, with the Democrats regaining control of the Senate and the growing public demand for affordable healthcare, Sanders is once again pushing for the bill.\n\nThe Medicare for All bill would replace the current private health insurance system with a single-payer healthcare system, funded by taxes. The bill would cover all medical expenses, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, and mental health services. It would also eliminate copays, deductibles, and premiums, making healthcare more affordable for everyone.\n\nHowever, the proposal has faced criticism from some quarters, with opponents arguing that it would be too expensive and could lead to longer wait times for medical procedures. Sanders and his supporters, however, argue that the benefits of universal healthcare outweigh the costs and that the current healthcare system is already expensive and inefficient.\n\nThe Medicare for All bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate in the coming weeks, and Sanders has already secured the support of several Democratic senators. The bill's success, however, will depend on whether it can garner enough support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass through Congress.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the Medicare for All proposal is likely to remain a hot topic in the ongoing healthcare debate, as Americans continue to grapple with the rising costs of healthcare and the need for affordable, comprehensive coverage for all.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post.

To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson—all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated—and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it).

In Pennsylvania, a new law has been proposed that would hold drivers financially responsible for any accidents caused while they were texting, even if they weren't the one who sent or received the message. This law is part of a growing trend to make texting while driving a more serious offense.\n\nIn other news, a recent court ruling in California has set a precedent for texting and driving lawsuits. The case involved a woman who was texting while driving and caused an accident, resulting in injuries to another driver. The jury found the texting driver 100% at fault and awarded the injured party $40,000 in damages. This ruling could pave the way for more texting while driving lawsuits in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, a new law has gone into effect that bans texting while driving in school zones. The law also extends to school buses, making it a Class C misdemeanor to text while driving in these areas.\n\nIn other news, a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that distracted driving, including texting, caused 3,450 fatalities in 2016. This is a 9% increase from the previous year. The NHTSA is urging drivers to put down their phones and focus on the road.\n\nFinally, a new app called \"DriveMode\" is being developed to help prevent texting while driving.

The app also blocks incoming calls and notifications, helping to keep the driver's focus on the road.\n\nIn summary, texting while driving is a dangerous distraction that can lead to accidents and lawsuits.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says.

The study, published in the journal European Urology, analyzed data from over 70,000 men in the U.K. and found that those who consumed more than 3 cups of coffee a day had a 20% lower risk of developing prostate cancer compared to those who did not consume caffeine. The researchers believe that caffeine may help prevent the disease by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.\n\nIn other news, scientists have discovered that older fathers may pass on their aging genes to their children, leading to health issues later in life. The study, published in the journal eLife, found that as men age, their sperm contains more mutations, which can be passed on to their offspring. These mutations can increase the risk of developing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n\nA new study has found that men who eat a diet rich in processed meat, such as bacon and sausages, have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer. The research, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, found that men who consumed more than 50 grams of processed meat per day had a 38% higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared to those who ate less than 20 grams per day.\n\nA new study has found that men who drink alcohol regularly may be at a higher risk of developing erectile dysfunction. The research, published in the journal Andrology, found that men who drank more than 14 alcoholic beverages per week were more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than those who drank less. The study also found that the risk was even greater for men who consumed alcohol in the hours leading up to sexual activity.\n\nFinally, a new study has found that men who eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer. The research, published in the journal European Urology, found that men who consumed at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day had a 21% lower risk of developing prostate cancer compared to those who ate fewer than two servings per day. The study also found that certain fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, crucifer", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs. More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}

The storm caused extensive damage throughout the state, leaving millions without power and causing billions of dollars in damages. In the aftermath of the storm, the Internet Archive announced its plan to archive all broken websites due to the hurricane, in an effort to preserve the web history of the affected areas.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc in Florida, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The storm made landfall near Marco Island, with winds reaching up to 130 miles per hour. The storm surge caused significant flooding in many coastal areas, and heavy rainfall led to widespread power outages. In Miami-Dade County alone, over 700,000 customers were left without power.\n\nThe storm caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure throughout the state. In Miami-Dade County, the storm surge caused flooding in many low-lying areas, including the Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami. The storm also caused widespread damage to homes and businesses, with some areas experiencing complete destruction.\n\nDespite the devastation, rescue efforts were underway throughout the state. Emergency responders worked to evacuate stranded residents and provide aid to those in need. The National Guard and other military personnel were deployed to assist with search and rescue operations, as well as providing security and logistical support.\n\nThe full extent of the damage caused by Hurricane Irma is still being assessed, but it is clear that the storm will have a significant impact on the affected areas for months, if not years, to come. The recovery effort is expected to be long and costly, with estimates putting the damage at over $50 billion.\n\nDespite the challenges, the resilience of the affected communities was on display as they began the long road to recovery. Neighbors came together to help one another, and volunteers from across the country arrived to lend a hand. The spirit of unity and determination was a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nAs the cleanup and rebuilding efforts continue, it is clear that the road to recovery will be a long one.

That is technically below \"major hurricane\" status, notes the AP, though the distinction may be small comfort to cities along its path. Perhaps the biggest concern continues to be the densely populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area, thought to be \"woefully ill-equipped\" to handle such a big storm, per the Washington Post. Irma should arrive there after midnight. “Today is going to the be the long day,” says Mark DeMaria of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
