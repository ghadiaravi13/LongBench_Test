The video, which was published by the political news website Mother Jones, sparked a flurry of media attention and jokes about Perry's apparent thirst for syrup.\n\nHowever, the Perry campaign was quick to downplay the incident, with spokesperson Ray Sullivan telling reporters that the governor had simply been greeting supporters and that the bottle of maple syrup had been a gift. Perry himself later joked about the incident during a speech, saying, \"I've been to Iowa before, but I've never had it this sweet.\"\n\nHowever, the maple syrup controversy was quickly overshadowed by more serious news. Just days after the video emerged, it was reported that Perry had authorized the execution of 14 inmates in Texas, including one mentally retarded man, in a single day. The mass execution, which took place on August 24, was the largest in the United States since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.\n\nPerry's decision to carry out the executions drew criticism from human rights groups and some political opponents, who accused him of being insensitive to the plight of the condemned men. Perry defended his actions, saying that the men had been given due process and that the legal system had run its course.\n\nThe controversy over Perry's handling of the executions came at a sensitive time for the governor, as he was gearing up for a possible run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Some critics accused him of being insensitive to the plight of the condemned men and of using the executions as a political tool to boost his image as a tough-on-crime candidate. Others defended Perry, arguing that he was simply carrying out the will of the people of Texas and upholding the law.\n\nThe controversy over Perry's handling of the executions did not seem to have a significant impact on his presidential campaign, however.

Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest.

The first passage reported that US archaeologists, led by Barry Rolett, have discovered evidence of a pre-Columbian settlement in the southeastern United States. The settlement, located in Florida, dates back to around 500 AD and is believed to have been inhabited by a group of people who were part of the larger Mississippian culture. The team discovered pottery, stone tools, and other artifacts at the site, which they believe provide important insights into the lives of these early Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, a team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, has discovered a new species of ancient human relative in a cave in the Philippines. The fossil, which dates back around 50,000 years, is believed to be a previously unknown hominin species, distinct from both modern humans and Neanderthals. The researchers have named the new species Homo luzonensis, after the island of Luzon where it was discovered.\n\nThe discovery of Homo luzonensis adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests the Philippines was a melting pot of human evolution, with a diverse range of hominin species inhabiting the islands at different times. The discovery also raises new questions about the relationships between different human lineages and the timing and patterns of human migration out of Africa.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Homo luzonensis is a significant find in the field of human evolution, shedding new light on the complex history of our species and our closest relatives. The ongoing research on this fascinating fossil will undoubtedly yield new insights into the diversity and adaptability of early humans.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Homo luzonensis in the Philippines provides important new insights into the diversity of early human populations and the complex evolutionary history of our species. The finding of this new hominin species challenges our current understanding of human evolution and highlights the importance of continued research and exploration in the field of anthropology.\n\nAs we continue to uncover new fossil evidence and advance our understanding of human history, it is important to remember that our species is not unique in its capacity for adaptation and innovation. The discovery of Homo luzonensis serves as a reminder that there is still much to learn about the incredible journey of human evolution.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Hom", "answers": ["The United Nations' cultural body is on the trail of Christopher Columbus' flagship—and it says the wreck that an expedition identified as the Santa Maria earlier this year is a different, much younger ship. As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest.

The first report, from the Associated Press, details how a Swedish doctor has successfully transplanted a windpipe from a donor into a patient, marking a world first in the field of regenerative medicine. The doctor, Paolo Macchiarini, used a combination of stem cells and a 3D printer to create a windpipe that was a perfect match for the patient.\n\nMeanwhile, another Swedish medical team has made history by performing the world's first double-lung transplant using lungs from a genetically modified pig. The team at Lund University transplanted the lungs into a patient with a severe form of emphysema, and the patient is reportedly doing well. The use of genetically modified pigs could potentially solve the shortage of human donor lungs.\n\nThese groundbreaking medical achievements demonstrate the potential of regenerative medicine and the use of animal organs to save lives.

In Passage 1, researchers discovered that notothenioid fish, which inhabit the Antarctic waters, have antifreeze proteins in their blood that prevent ice crystals from forming. These proteins allow the fish to survive in temperatures as low as -2 degrees Celsius. The researchers also found that the fish's gills are able to extract oxygen from the water even when it is frozen, allowing them to breathe under the ice.\n\nIn another study, scientists discovered that Antarctic krill, a key species in the Southern Ocean food chain, have a unique metabolic process that helps them survive in the frigid waters. Krill use a substance called supercoolant to prevent their body fluids from freezing, even when the water temperature drops below freezing. This adaptation allows them to maintain their metabolic functions and continue feeding, making them a crucial link in the Antarctic food chain.\n\nIn addition to these physiological adaptations, some Antarctic organisms have behavioral strategies to cope with the extreme conditions. For example, some krill species migrate to warmer waters during the winter months to avoid freezing temperatures. Emperor penguins huddle together in large groups to keep warm and conserve energy during the harsh winter months.\n\nDespite the challenges of living in such an extreme environment, Antarctic organisms have adapted in remarkable ways, allowing them to thrive and contribute to complex food webs.

He is now considering working abroad again, despite the risks and uncertainty.\n\nThe situation is similar for many other Indian engineers and technicians who have been working in the Gulf region for years. The economic downturn in the Middle East has led to a significant decrease in demand for labor, leaving many workers unemployed or underemployed.\n\nThe Indian government and various organizations are trying to help these workers by providing skills training and job placement services. However, the situation remains challenging, and many engineers and technicians are forced to accept lower-paying jobs or return to their home villages.\n\nThe economic downturn in the Middle East has also affected the Indian construction industry, which relies heavily on expatriate labor. Many construction projects have been delayed or cancelled, leaving thousands of workers without jobs.\n\nThe Indian government has announced several measures to help unemployed workers, including skill development programs and financial assistance. However, many experts believe that more needs to be done to address the root causes of unemployment, such as lack of infrastructure, inadequate education, and limited opportunities for entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the meantime, many Indian workers continue to look for jobs abroad, hoping to find better opportunities and higher wages.

According to both reports, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key, has announced plans to increase the price of cigarettes in an effort to reduce smoking rates. The price hike could see a pack of 20 cigarettes costing up to $20, making New Zealand one of the most expensive countries for cigarettes.\n\nThe potential impact of the price increase on smokers and the tobacco industry has been a topic of debate. Some argue that the increase will discourage smoking, particularly among young people, and generate revenue for the government. Others claim that the price hike will disproportionately affect low-income households and lead to an increase in smuggling and black market sales.\n\nThe tobacco industry has already expressed concerns about the proposed price increase, warning of potential job losses and economic consequences. However, health advocates argue that the higher prices are necessary to reduce smoking rates and improve public health.\n\nThe New Zealand government is currently considering the legislation, which would see the price of cigarettes increase by around $2 per pack. The proposed price hike has sparked debate and controversy, with some arguing that it is an effective way to reduce smoking rates and others claiming that it will unfairly target low-income individuals.\n\nThe impact of the price increase on the tobacco industry and smokers remains to be seen.

The Pacific Ocean provides essential habitat for various marine species, including salmon, rockfish, and forage fish, which are crucial to the food chain and the livelihoods of coastal communities.\n\nOne major issue threatening the marine ecosystem is overfishing. According to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, overfishing is a significant problem in the Pacific Ocean, with many fish populations at or below sustainable levels. The overexploitation of fish stocks can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems, threatening the livelihoods of fishermen and the food security of coastal communities.\n\nAnother major issue is climate change and its impact on ocean temperatures and acidity levels. Warmer waters can lead to the death of coral reefs, which provide essential habitat for many marine species. Acidification can make it harder for shellfish and other organisms to build and maintain their shells and skeletons.\n\nAdditionally, pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and plastic debris can harm marine life and disrupt food chains. Plastic waste, in particular, poses a significant threat to marine animals, as they can mistake it for food or become entangled in it.\n\nTo address these issues, it is essential to implement sustainable fishing practices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce plastic waste.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift.

The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, found that while the number of vegetarians and vegans in the U.S. has remained relatively stable in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people who are reducing their meat intake but not fully adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. The study also found that younger generations are less likely to identify as vegetarian or vegan compared to older generations.\n\nMeanwhile, a new report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has found that global meat production is expected to increase by 17% by 2030, driven by population growth and rising demand for animal products in developing countries. The report also highlights the environmental and health challenges associated with meat production, including greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and antibiotic resistance.\n\nIn response to these trends, some countries and cities are taking steps to reduce meat consumption and promote plant-based diets. For example, the government of India has launched a campaign to encourage people to eat less meat and dairy, citing health and environmental reasons. In Europe, some cities have implemented \"Meatless Mondays\" or other initiatives to encourage people to reduce their meat consumption.\n\nHowever, these efforts face challenges from the meat industry and some consumers who view meat as an essential part of their diet. Some argue that reducing meat consumption could negatively impact farmers and rural communities, while others argue that plant-based diets may not provide all the necessary nutrients.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is growing momentum for reducing meat consumption as a way to address environmental, health, and animal welfare concerns. Some experts believe that a shift towards plant-based diets could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and reduce animal suffering.\n\nHowever, achieving this goal will require significant changes in food production, distribution, and consumption patterns. It will also require education and awareness campaigns to help consumers make informed choices about their diets and to challenge the powerful meat industry.\n\nIn conclusion, reducing meat consumption is an important step towards creating a more sustainable and equitable food system.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them.

He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast—which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"—and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low—but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6707}

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4329}

The study, published in the journal \"PLoS ONE,\" involved showing participants videos of people telling the truth or lying about their age, and asking them to guess which was which. The participants were able to correctly identify lies about 54% of the time, which is significantly better than chance.\n\nThe researchers identified several key signs of deception, including longer gaze duration, fewer blinks, and more micro-expressions. These findings could have important implications for fields such as law enforcement and human resources, where detecting lies is crucial.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that reading body language and facial expressions is not an exact science, and there are many factors that can influence whether someone is telling the truth or not. Additionally, people can be trained to hide their signs of deception, making it even more challenging to determine if they are lying or telling the truth.\n\nDespite these challenges, the ability to read nonverbal cues is an important skill for anyone to develop, especially in professional settings where trust and credibility are essential. By paying attention to subtle signs and practicing active listening, we can improve our ability to detect lies and build stronger, more authentic relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no foolproof method for detecting lies, research suggests that paying attention to facial expressions, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues can help us identify when someone is being dishonest.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time.

We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

They found that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which was unexpected based on current theories.\n\nTo explain this phenomenon, scientists propose the existence of dark energy, a mysterious substance that makes up about 68% of the universe.

It suggests that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, but rather accelerating, which challenges current theories about the cosmos.\n\nScientists continue to study dark energy and its properties in hopes of gaining a better understanding of this mysterious force.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

The study's authors warn that this could lead to increased solar activity and potentially harmful effects on technology and human health.

It has committed more than 40 successful bombing attacks and has been on the frontline of clashes against Assad forces, adds the Daily Beast. The alliance is not a surprise (Obama labeled it a terrorist organization last year), but it is concerning, says CNN. Al-Nusra's success on the battlefield and reputation for distributing free bread makes it popular with everyday Syrians. With a powerful army in Syria, al-Qaeda would gain a strong strategic position in the Middle East, and a safe haven for long-term scheming."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4068}
{"pred": "\n\nIn the first passage, Women's reproductive rights are under threat as an international group, Women on Waves, plans to send a ship to Poland to provide abortions at sea. The Polish government has banned abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. Women's rights activists argue that this law violates women's autonomy and human rights.\n\nIn another development, a US judge has ruled that a 15-week abortion ban in Texas is unconstitutional. The law, which was set to take effect on September 1, 2021, would have prohibited most abortions in the state. The ruling is a victory for abortion rights advocates, who argue that women should have the right to choose when and if they want to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nIn other news, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared monkeypox a global health emergency. The virus, which causes flu-like symptoms and a rash, has spread to more than 50 countries, mostly in Europe and North America. The declaration comes as health officials scramble to contain the outbreak and develop vaccines and treatments.\n\nIn other news, the Taliban have banned women from working in schools and universities in Afghanistan. The decree, which came into effect on Monday, has sparked outrage and concern from human rights groups and international organizations. The Taliban have also imposed other restrictions on women, including a ban on traveling long distances without a male chaperone.\n\nIn other news, the United States has announced that it will withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021. The decision comes after nearly 20 years of military engagement in the country. The withdrawal is expected to be completed by the end of August, and the US embassy in Kabul will remain open.\n\nIn other news, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Covid-19 pandemic a global health emergency, but has stopped short of declaring it a global pandemic. The organization has urged countries to take aggressive measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected over 118,000 people and killed over 4,200.\n\nIn other news, the US Supreme Court has ruled that a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion to their clients is unconst", "answers": ["A Dutch organization that advises women on reproductive rights has now launched a website to help US women terminate pregnancies on their own. The Guardian reports on the \"Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported\" portal, or SASS, set up by Women Help Women. Through it, 23 trained counselors will answer questions and give advice if women have already decided to take the drug misoprostol. The medication, which, when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone, keeps a pregnancy from happening, is only legal in the US at medical facilities, though it can be purchased OTC in Central American nations. A Women Help Women rep says the idea for the site came about after a Guardian story documenting a Texas woman's trip to Mexico to get the drug, and all the questions she had once she got it. The site won't provide pills, and organizers say they won't even suggest women take them—they're just there to keep women safe if they've already decided to. \"It's worse to just remain silent,\" says a UC San Francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a \"very safe and effective\" drug (though it's more effective taken with mifepristone, which isn't as easy to obtain). For women who do have complications and must seek medical care, the Washington Post notes they'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same, and that the drug isn't detectable via drug test. Abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period, and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them. Women Help Women is being cautious in case of legal ramifications: Its servers are located outside the US, as are its two dozen or so staffers."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6005}
