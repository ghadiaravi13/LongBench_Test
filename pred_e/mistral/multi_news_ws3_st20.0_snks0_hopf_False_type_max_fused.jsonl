The film, which stars Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, and Billy Crudup, is a sci-fi thriller that revitalizes the Alien franchise with its gripping storyline, beautiful visuals, and satisfying surprises. The film's central theme revolves around the origins and prospects for human life, and the balance between intelligent speculation, action, and philosophical considerations is well-executed.\n\nThe opening scene sets the tone for the film, with a synthetic named Walter engaging in a philosophical conversation with his \"father,\" an uncredited Guy Pearce. The crew of the Covenant, a giant ship headed for a distant planet, consists of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for humanity. However, when a space storm damages the ship's wind sails, the crew discovers a nearby \"hidden planet\" that seems potentially compatible to human life. Unfortunately, the beautiful landscapes hide deadly creatures that cause unimaginable mayhem.\n\nThe film also features a double performance by Michael Fassbender as Walter and his double, David, who co-starred in Prometheus. The two engage in a contest for dominance, touching on the notion of playing God. The writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, have made the most of the only source of sustained vitality in Scott's previous film, Prometheus.\n\nThe cast includes Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Carmen Ejogo, Jussie Smollett, Callie Hernandez, Amy Seimetz, Benjamin Rigby, and James Franco.

{"pred": "\n\nThe Pacific sardine population along the West Coast of North America is experiencing a severe decline, leading to concerns about the impact on the ecosystem and potential shifts in fishing pressure. Pacific sardines are a crucial forage fish that support a diverse range of marine species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) is urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and prohibit unregulated fishing on other forage fish species to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing hardships for fishermen, with steep cuts in catch limits and a lack of schools making it difficult to catch the fish. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but it is the steepest since the mid-20th century collapse of the sardine fishery. Some scientists believe that naturally occurring climate cycles, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, may be responsible for the decline.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is known for its boom-bust population cycles, and history shows that the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. However, without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. The population has dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006, and spawning has also taken a dive. In November 2013, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups argue that the catch should be halted outright.\n\nThe decline in sardine populations is causing concern for the health of marine mammals, seabirds, and other predators that rely on the fish for food. Researchers are studying the impact of the decline on the food web and the potential for cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. The value of forage fish, such as sardines, is worth more when left in the water as food for commercially important predators, according to a report by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force.\n\nFor further information, please visit pewenvironment.org/pacificfish and write to the Pacific Fishery Management Council at pfmc.comments@noaa.gov.", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1551}

The study, which used data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, found that sinusitis, ear infections, and pharyngitis were the top diagnoses leading to antibiotic prescriptions, with approximately half of these prescriptions being unnecessary. The study also revealed that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions being written for acute respiratory conditions. The CDC has set a goal of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use. The overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are a major public health concern. The Pew Charitable Trusts and CDC also released a report outlining data-driven targets for eliminating unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient facilities across the country, with a focus on acute respiratory conditions. The report emphasized the importance of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. The CDC has previously identified antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest public health challenges of our time, with at least 2 million people getting an antibiotic-resistant infection and at least 23,000 people dying from these infections annually in the United States.

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

Instead, the research suggests that west-facing solar panels could produce more electricity during peak demand hours and reduce homeowners' electricity usage by a greater extent.\n\nThe study analyzed 50 homes in Austin, comparing the electricity production and usage patterns of west-facing and south-facing solar panels during summer peak demand periods. The results showed that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity homeowners needed to draw from the grid during peak hours by 65 percent, while homes with the conventional true-south orientation achieved a 54 percent reduction.\n\nBrewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street and co-author of the study, explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because they capture solar energy late in the afternoon, which is when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study also found that less electricity would go unused by homeowners with west-facing panels, making things easier for utility companies.

This lake likely existed for tens of thousands of years and could have supported microbial life, including chemolithoautotrophs. The rover also found evidence of water on other parts of Mars, making it more plausible that thousands of additional fossil formations of ancient streams, channels, deltas, and lakes are indeed what they appear to be.\n\nHowever, the search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds, one of the major goals of the Curiosity mission, has been complicated. While six different organic compounds have been identified, their origin remains unclear due to the presence of a chlorine-based compound that destroys organics when heated and a leak of an organic solvent into the rover's ovens.\n\nDespite the challenges, the rover's discoveries have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. The radiation on Mars, however, would be fatal to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. The rover's Radiation Assessment Detector has made the first measurements of radiation on the surface of Mars, and the results are sobering.\n\nThe rover's team has also found a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars, which could help in finding places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure.

However, subsequent attempts to locate the snake failed, and it was assumed to be a labelling error and struck from taxonomic registries.\n\nRecently, researchers Daniel Mulcahy from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and Juan Martinez Gomez from Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find the elusive snake. They followed Beebe's original field notes and timed their expedition to replicate his steps. One of Martinez Gomez's graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot the snake since 1936.\n\nDNA analysis confirmed that the snake was indeed a distinct species and was most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey from the mainland on a tree trunk that was washed out to sea.\n\nThe Clarion nightsnake is now recognized as a full species and is found exclusively on the island. Its rediscovery is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems, and one inhabitant, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat in the 1970s but was later re-introduced to the islands.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC also confirmed the rediscovery of the Clarion nightsnake, stating that it is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity.

It does not change the treatment plan, improve survival, or make the cancer less likely to recur. However, it can cause complications like infection and lymphedema. The discovery is significant because surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years, believing it would prolong women’s lives.\n\nThe second study, conducted by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, found that for women with early-stage breast cancer and one or two positive armpit nodes, removing additional nodes did not improve survival or disease-free survival.

The outcome of the caucuses is expected to provide some clarity in the race, as a poor performance could mark the end of the road for some candidates. The contest is expected to draw upwards of 100,000 to 120,000 voters. According to the latest polls, the race is a three-way dead heat between Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum, with 41% of those who have a first choice still open to changing their minds.\n\nMitt Romney, the current front-runner, has been campaigning heavily in Iowa and is banking on his electability as a key to success. He has raised significant funds and has the support of many establishment Republicans. Ron Paul, in second place in the polls, has a strong following among libertarian-leaning voters and college students. He has been attacking the media for discounting him and has drawn large crowds at his rallies. Rick Santorum, in third place, has been gaining momentum and has raised more money in the last few days than he did in the last few months. He is appealing to Christian conservatives and those opposed to abortion.\n\nOther candidates, such as Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, are also campaigning in Iowa but are not expected to do well. Gingrich has been critical of the negative ads in the campaign and has called for a return to positive campaigning. Perry has made a final plea to voters to decide by conscience, not poll numbers. Michele Bachmann, who had a strong showing in the Ames Straw Poll but has since seen her campaign falter, is also campaigning in Iowa but is not expected to do well.\n\nTen counties in Iowa are considered key indicators of the outcome of the caucuses. These counties include Black Hawk County, which is reliably Democratic but has a special relevance due to its connection to Michele Bachmann; Dallas County, which is Iowa's fastest-growing county and has a high turnout; Dubuque County, which is Romney territory but has a large Catholic population; and Johnson County, which is home to the University of Iowa and has a significant number of Republicans.

Health officials have quarantined approximately 80 people who came into contact with the victim, one of whom has developed early symptoms of the disease. However, testing on 11 potential cases, including the victim's brother, came back negative. Marburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days and initial symptoms include fever, headache, and myalgia, which are similar to many other diseases. After a few days, symptoms worsen and can include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a rash. Severe cases progress to jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction. Marburg is not an airborne virus and is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues, or bodily fluids of an infected person or an infected primate or fruit bat. The first outbreak of Marburg was in Europe in 1967, and since then, there have been a dozen recorded outbreaks, most of which involved just a single patient. Marburg can have a high death rate for those infected, ranging from 23% to 90%. There is no cure for the virus, and hospitalized patients should receive general supportive therapy. Uganda, which has previously experienced outbreaks of both Ebola and Marburg, has put in place rigorous surveillance and disease control measures and has the capacity to deal with this health threat. The most recent Marburg outbreak in Uganda infected 15 people and killed four.

The study, led by researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 15,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II from 1991 to 2001. The researchers found that women who consumed more potatoes had a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Substituting two servings of potatoes per week with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods was associated with a 9-12% lower risk of gestational diabetes. Potatoes have a high glycemic index, which can elevate blood sugar levels more than most other foods. The study's authors recommend swapping potatoes with green leafy vegetables or whole grains, which are lower on the glycemic index and have more healthful nutrients. The findings do not prove that potato consumption directly causes gestational diabetes, but the researchers suggest that moderation in potato consumption is important for pregnant women. The study's limitations include the lack of diversity in the study population and the self-reported nature of dietary intake and diabetes diagnosis. More research is needed to confirm the findings.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

From 1992 to 2011, Antarctica lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice a year, but from 2012 to 2017, the melt rate increased to over 241 billion tons a year. The melting is primarily occurring in West Antarctica, where most of the ice loss is taking place and the ice sheet is in a state of collapse. The study, which involved 88 co-authors and used 10 to 15 satellites, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations, found that forces driving the ice loss are not going to get any better in a warming climate. Warming of the southern ocean, which is connected to shifting winds and global warming from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas, is the main cause of the melt. East Antarctica, which was gaining ice before 2012, is now losing about 31 tons (28 metric tons) a year.

It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order. And it's why last week's news reduced the odds of the GOP retaining its majority from a good bet to even money.\" Ulterior motives? Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry of the Week calls Corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \"establishment\" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? James Fallows at the Atlantic writes that if Corker truly believes Trump might blunder his way into World War III, he has an obligation to \"do something about it\" by providing a crucial check on Trump's actions through his position as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. \"Talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts.\" WSJ weighs in: The conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal thinks Corker spoke the truth about the president's \"lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are Rosie O'Donnell,\" and it hopes other top Republicans follow Corker's lead because it might actually help. Little reaction: NBC News rounds up reaction from top Republicans to Corker's statements about the president and finds \"silence or a shrug.\" A typical sentiment, from Marco Rubio: \"You'll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven't made that statement.\" Trump's new criticism comes just a week before a Senate vote important to Trump's tax plan, notes the New York Times."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4346}

In the first incident, a record number of climbers attempted to reach the summit, resulting in at least four deaths and concerns about overcrowding.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60.

Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. They suggest that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences. The study was published in the journal PLoS One.\n\nThe researchers also found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as more intelligent by both male and female participants. This link between perceived attractiveness and perceived intelligence was stronger for women’s faces than men’s faces. The researchers propose that one possible explanation for why people can predict men’s intelligence based on their face, but not predict women’s intelligence based on their face, is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men’s faces. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women.\n\nThe study received funding from the Czech Grant Agency project GACR P407/11/1464 and Charles University in Prague project UNCE 204004.

In private conversations, Trump has reportedly expressed that the midterms are not about him and that his 2020 reelection bid is the \"real election.\" He is also expected to lash out at the media for allegedly opposing him.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are trying to dampen expectations for a \"blue wave\" in the elections, as key races in the House have tightened, and winning back the Senate majority looks increasingly out of reach. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez and Senator Bernie Sanders have both downplayed the idea of a blue wave, urging their supporters to turn out and vote.\n\nEarly voting data from seven closely watched states shows that Republican-affiliated voters have outpaced Democratic-affiliated voters in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas. This trend could put a dent in Democratic hopes for a blue wave in the midterm elections.\n\nPresident Trump is campaigning for Republican Ted Cruz in Texas, who is facing a tight race against Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott have warned that O'Rourke represents a national Democratic Party trying to turn Texas into a liberal state. O'Rourke, on the other hand, has objected to the partisan undertones in their message and emphasized that the election is not about red or blue states.\n\nThousands of people have already started lining up for early voting in Houston, Texas, with some camping out overnight to be among the first to cast their ballots.

The existence of Planet Nine is inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. Telescopes on at least two continents are currently searching for the object, which is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and could be the fifth-largest planet in our solar system. The discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure the models of the solar system and potentially rewrite textbooks.\n\nMike Brown, one of the astronomers involved in the discovery, has previously been referred to as the \"Pluto Killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion from planet status in 2006.

Disney CEO Robert Iger attributes this success to investments in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, as well as the film studio. The film studio has been a major driver of Disney's growth, with recent hits like The Avengers generating billions in revenue through merchandise, TV spin-offs, and potential theme park attractions. However, the success of big-budget films has made it harder for smaller films to get made, as studios focus on producing films that will generate the most revenue down the line.\n\nJohn Waters, a well-known filmmaker, shared a fantasy in his book Carsick about a hitchhiker offering to finance his movie. This anecdote highlights the current struggle for filmmakers to secure funding for mid-budget films, which have all but disappeared from the industry. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was possible to finance mid-budget films through the studio system or independently. However, over the past decade and a half, studios have shifted their focus to making fewer films and betting big on potential blockbusters. This has left many filmmakers, including David Lynch, Francis Ford Coppola, and Spike Lee, struggling to get their films produced.\n\nThe lack of funding for mid-budget films has led many filmmakers to turn to television, where they can have more creative control and reach a larger audience. Netflix, HBO, and Showtime have all attracted high-profile directors, including David Fincher, Jodie Foster, and David Lynch, to create original content for their platforms. However, television budgets are often scarcely better than those of independent films, and the storytelling is open-ended and rarely offers the satisfying conclusions that a great movie can provide. Additionally, filmmakers without significant clout may find network executives less accommodating than their film-exec counterparts.\n\nThe current filmmaking model may not be sustainable, with attendance and box office numbers declining and the foreign sales model facing challenges.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan. Now, she says, studios \"have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world.\" And few seasoned directors want to test the indie market, where tons of under-$2 million films are vying for attention. So Spike Lee has funded a film via Kickstarter, Steven Soderbergh publicly quit feature filmmaking last year, and other directors are turning to TV for creative freedom.

Astronomers have measured the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy, and the numbers indicate that the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe. This discrepancy may offer insights into the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and dark radiation, which make up 95 percent of the universe and don't emit light. Researchers believe that dark matter and the dark energy it carries may explain the acceleration of the universe's expansion. The most recent calculation of the universe's rate of expansion, called the Hubble constant, is believed to be the most accurate ever, with a margin of error of just 2.4 percent. However, astronomers expected the new calculations to forge an agreeable link with those derived from observations of the Big Bang afterglow collected by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Instead, the ends of the measurements do not quite meet in the middle, and researchers are continuing to go over the data to try to reduce the margin for error even further. Some scientists urge caution, suggesting that the most likely explanation is a mistake in the most recent calculations. However, if the science is correct, it could challenge some of the basic precepts surrounding the functioning of our universe. Possible explanations include the possibility that dark energy is pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed, or that dark matter has some as-yet undiscovered oddities. Another possibility is that Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate. The new numbers are based on the team's efforts to acquire a more precise understanding of the universe's current expansion rate, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope. The team refined the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae. By measuring about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and comparing the apparent brightness of both types of stars, the researchers were able to determine the true brightness of the Type Ia supernovae and calculate distances to roughly 300 of them in far-fl", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.

Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

They were deeply in love, and both their families embraced their union. However, staffers at Concord Care Center in Garner told Rayhons he was no longer allowed in his wife's room because he made her roommate uncomfortable.\n\nThe question of how to deal with sex by those who aren't mentally competent is complex. It's important to consider the nature of the parties' past relationship. Until several decades ago, a husband's forcing his wife to have sex wasn't generally considered rape in the United States. However, it's now widely accepted that spouses are entitled to say \"no.\"\n\nIowa law treats spouses differently from others when it comes to sexual abuse. Rayhons is charged with third-degree sexual abuse, which is committed when a sex act is done by force or against the will of the other person, or between persons who are not cohabiting as husband and wife and if the other person is suffering from a mental defect or incapacity which precludes giving consent. However, the law does not make an exception for spouses who are no longer cohabiting, which is the prosecutor's theory in the Rayhons case.\n\nSexual touching of a sleeping lover is criminalized under Iowa law, which lacks a spouse limitation. This can cause problems when third parties learn of the incident and complain to the authorities. The law should be crafted to preclude this, as Iowa law does to some extent but not sufficiently.\n\nThe case of Henry Rayhons and Donna Young raises complex issues about consent, mental capacity, and the role of the law in regulating intimate relationships.

Both stories highlight the innovation and competition in the baking industry, as well as the enduring appeal of hybrid pastries.\n\nIn the first story, the author explores the coexistence and competition between Maury Rubin's pretzel croissant and Dominique Ansel's Cronut. The pretzel croissant, a combination of a croissant and a pretzel, has been a staple in lower Manhattan for years, while the Cronut, a deep-fried croissant-doughnut, has created a sensation with long lines forming at its SoHo location. The author argues that this coexistence represents something new, pervasive, and potentially perverse: the hybridized and fetishized schnecken. The pastry industry is constantly evolving, with doughnuts crossing with croissants, croissants crossing with pretzels, and Montreal bagels being made puffier for New York tastes. The author questions whether the pretzel croissant is the forerunner of the Cronut or merely its parallel creature, and whether the Cronut is a craze that will die in shame and embarrassment or a true contribution to the common cupboard.\n\nIn the second story, Dunkin' Donuts announces the launch of its Croissant Donut, a croissant-doughnut hybrid, for a limited time in the United States.

He had challenged the validity of these charges in the High Court, arguing they were political, but lost and was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and placed on a two-year good behavior bond.\n\nMonis had a history of religiously inspired activism, but officials say there is no evidence his actions were linked to international Islamist movements. He had recently posted on his website that Shia Muslims were rejectionists and rejected the \"new religion\" of moderate Islam.

The BFG, a movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's novel, earned $22.2 million from domestic audiences and $3.9 million from overseas markets, far below its $140 million budget. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg, stars Mark Rylance as a friendly giant and has received positive reviews, but failed to attract audiences.\n\nThe reasons for The BFG's poor performance are unclear. Some believe that Spielberg's box office clout is no longer what it once was, while others argue that Roald Dahl's stories are not as well-known as those of J.K. Rowling. The title of the film, which stands for \"Big Friendly Giant,\" is also confusing to some. Additionally, the film lacked big-name stars and suffered from bad timing, opening in a crowded summer movie season.\n\nDespite The BFG's disappointing box office performance, Spielberg's track record as a director remains strong. He has had few outright box office failures, with most of his films either being critical and commercial successes or making their budgets back. However, The BFG marks the first such film that was intended primarily as a commercial venture.\n\nThe film's failure to connect with audiences may signal a shift in the movie industry, with audiences increasingly drawn to franchises and established properties rather than original films.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

Decades later, Bruce Springsteen drew from Seeger's repertoire of traditional music for his 2006 album, \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,\" and performed \"This Land Is Your Land\" with him at the Obama inaugural in 2009.\n\nSeeger was a vocal advocate for various causes throughout his career, including worker's rights, civil rights, world peace, and environmental conservation. He was blacklisted by the US government in the 1950s for his leftist stance and was charged with contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about his past membership in the Communist Party. However, his sentence was overturned on appeal.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Seeger started an improbable project: a sailing ship, the Clearwater, that would crusade for cleaner water on the Hudson River.

Jabhat al-Nusra, which has been responsible for many successful attacks against government military targets, has been tagged as a terrorist organization by the Obama administration due to its links with Al Qaeda. The merger has raised concerns in Baghdad, where intelligence officials have reported increased cooperation between the two groups in a number of deadly attacks. In Syria, the merger complicates the battlefield where Western powers have been trying to funnel weapons, training, and aid to more secular rebel groups and army defectors.

The group will connect US women with counselors who can provide real-time instructions on using misoprostol for a DIY abortion and will also strive to connect women with abortion funds if payment is a barrier. The inspiration for the project came from a Guardian article about a young Texas woman who traveled to Mexico to purchase an abortion-inducing drug over the counter due to the high cost of an abortion in the US. The legal implications of the project are uncertain, as several US women have been charged with crimes for attempting to induce their own abortions. Women Help Women will delete conversations between clients and counselors after seven days and has located its servers and counselors abroad to minimize legal risks. The medical risks of self-administering an abortion drug without medical supervision are thought to be lower than the legal risks.

He criticized the negative tone of the Republican race and the personal attacks, and expressed hope that the remaining candidates would focus on issues.

The surveillance reports contained valuable political information on the Trump transition team, such as their meetings and views on foreign policy matters. Rice's requests to unmask the names of Trump officials were discovered during a review of the government's policy on unmasking, which is typically used to protect the identities of U.S. persons in intelligence reports.\n\nThe revelation adds an important element to the ongoing investigations into ties between Trump associates and a Russian influence operation against Hillary Clinton during the election.

However, her requests to learn the identities of Trump officials discussed in intelligence reports during the transition period raises concerns about the potential misuse of surveillance information for political purposes.\n\nThe news about Rice's unmasking requests sheds light on the strange behavior of Nunes in the last few weeks.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes.

The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

In 2009, Greece reported a larger deficit than previously reported, leading to concerns about its ability to pay back its debt. In 2010, Greece received a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, but the rescue failed due to the IMF's flawed analysis and the lack of debt forgiveness. The bailout came with conditions, including austerity measures and reforms, which were not fully implemented, leading to economic contraction and public discontent.\n\nIn January 2015, a new Greek government, led by Alexis Tsipras and the radical left Syriza party, came to power and sought to renegotiate the bailout terms. The new government wanted to restore spending cuts, reverse revenue hikes, and seek debt forgiveness. However, the European institutions disagreed, citing the need to avoid setting a precedent and the lack of trust in Greece's ability to implement reforms.\n\nThe IMF loan that came due on June 29, 2015, was important because it was a key payment to the organization, and Greece's failure to pay could have led to its expulsion from the program.

The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. “I don’t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,” says a US economist. “When you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.” Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6571}

However, in biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage, or the marriage of one man and more than one woman. In the early 1840s, under the direction of Church President Joseph Smith, plural marriage was practiced among some Latter-day Saints for over half a century. The reasons for this practice include increasing the number of children born in the gospel covenant, creating a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints, and reducing per-capita inequality of wealth.\n\nPlural marriage resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes and shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways. Marriage became available to virtually all who desired it, per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished, and ethnic intermarriages were increased. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints, who came to see themselves as a \"peculiar people.\"\n\nThe revelation on plural marriage emerged partly from Joseph Smith's study of the Old Testament in 1831. He received a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage and introduced it to close associates. Although the Lord commanded the adoption and later the cessation of plural marriage, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment.\n\nPlural marriage was a challenging aspect of the Restoration for both Joseph Smith and other Church members. It violated cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. However, many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them courage to accept this practice.\n\nThe first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed in April 1841. Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage.

The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home.

The researchers, Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, observed that male players in Halo 3 were generally cordial to each other, but men with lower skills tended to make derogatory comments towards female gamers. This behavior was more pronounced when these men were performing poorly. The researchers argue that this behavior is a result of men trying to maintain their social status in the face of a female intruder in a male-dominated hierarchy. The findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that sexist behavior is a response to threats to male status.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

Wright (1977), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools. The Court held that the history of the Eighth Amendment and previous decisions make it clear that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was designed to protect those convicted of crime. The openness of the public school environment and the community's supervision afford significant safeguards against abuses, and legal constraints under common law limit punishment to what is reasonably necessary for proper education and discipline. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also does not require notice and hearing prior to imposition of corporal punishment. The Court found that liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment is implicated when public school authorities punish a child for misconduct by restraint and infliction of physical pain. However, the child's interest in procedural safeguards is outweighed by the significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment provided by the common law.\n\nIn related news, a resolution was adopted by the American Psychological Association opposing the use of corporal punishment in schools, juvenile facilities, child care nurseries, and all other institutions where children are cared for or educated. The resolution cited evidence that corporal punishment can reduce the likelihood of employing more effective and humane ways of interacting with children, create a negative impression in the child, and train children to use physical violence to control behavior. The resolution also noted that effective use of punishment requires precision in timing, duration, intensity, and specificity, and that punishment administered in institutional settings without attention to these factors is likely to instill hostility, rage, and a sense of powerlessness.\n\nIn Alabama, data from the 2013-2014 school year showed that 107 of Alabama's 133 school districts engaged in the practice of paddling students, with 10,550 students, or 56%, of those who were paddled attending schools that enrolled kindergartners up to at least fifth graders.

The second incident, discovered by a security researcher in 2015, involved hackers gaining access to the networks running the United States power grid and obtained detailed engineering drawings of at least one power plant with the title \"Mission Critical.\" The drawings were so detailed that skilled attackers could have used them to knock out electricity flowing to millions of homes.\n\nExperts estimate that there have been about a dozen such intrusions in the last decade, most of which have not been reported to the government. These intrusions are more intricate and potentially dangerous than data theft and have not caused widespread blackouts yet. However, the concern is that if the geopolitical situation changes and Iran or other countries want to target these facilities, the stolen information could make it easier for them to do so.\n\nThe power grid is a lucrative target for cyberattacks due to its potential to cause widespread damage to daily life and the economy. The grid is designed to keep electricity flowing even when equipment or lines go down, but it is also aging and vulnerable to cyberattacks. Some power plants and transmission systems include equipment that is decades old and physically unable to handle electronic threats. The rush to connect smart meters and other smart appliances to the grid also creates new vulnerabilities.\n\nAuthorities take the threat seriously and have taken steps to help energy companies improve their cyber defenses. However, government red tape and the large number of municipal and rural utilities that need help limit the effectiveness of these efforts. Companies themselves are also vigilant but admit that no fortifications are foolproof.

The aftermath of the storm has raised larger political questions, particularly regarding the cost of recovery and the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such disasters.\n\nThe first issue that will test the nation's unity is funding the recovery from the storm. Early estimates put the cost of damages at tens of billions of dollars, and Congress has faced unprecedented partisan divides over Washington's role in meeting those costs in the past. In 2005, Vice President Mike Pence led an effort by House conservatives to offset any post-Katrina aid with offsetting budget cuts in other programs. Similarly, after Sandy in 2012, Mick Mulvaney proposed legislation to offset aid with across-the-board reductions in domestic programs. These earlier skirmishes raise the question of whether Congressional conservatives, including those from Texas, will again insist on offsetting any aid for Houston and the Gulf Coast with spending cuts elsewhere.\n\nThe second issue is the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such devastating storms. While scientists are quick to say that climate change didn't cause Harvey and that it's too early to determine whether the storm was made worse by global warming, they do agree that future storms will dump much more rain than the same size storms did in the past due to warmer air and water. Several studies show that the top 1 percent of the strongest downpours are already happening much more frequently, and calculations show that the rainfall received by Rockport, Texas, used to be a once-in-1,800-years event but is now a once-every-300-years event.

And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "all_classes": null, "length": 11232}

The cause of their deaths has long been a mystery, with no obvious physical injuries or major damage to the hull. Researchers have recently proposed a new theory that the crew was killed by a shock wave from the submarine's own torpedo blast.\n\nBiomechanist Rachel Lance, who is working on a book about the Hunley, conducted experiments using a one-sixth scale model of the submarine, the CSS Tiny. She set off test explosions next to the model to study the effects of the blast wave on the hull and the interior of the cabin.\n\nThe results of the experiments suggest that the shock wave from the torpedo blast would have traveled through the thin metal hull of the Hunley and into the cabin, causing pulmonary hemorrhage in the crew members. This theory is supported by historical accounts of men being killed or disabled at a distance from explosions without external injuries.\n\nThe Hunley Project, which maintains and researches the original submarine, has not yet commented on the findings. Previous research has concluded that neither phase of the explosion was severe enough to significantly impact the Hunley. However, the de-concretion process, which involves removing the sand and silt that has accumulated around the sub, may provide more information about the cause of the loss of the Hunley.\n\nThe crew members' skeletons were found to be in good condition when they were excavated from the Hunley's interior, with no signs of struggle or desperation. There is also a softball-sized chunk of iron missing from the forward conning tower, leading to the \"lucky shot\" theory that a stray bullet from the Housatonic may have punctured the tower and caused the sub to fill with water and sink. However, Lance's experiments suggest that this theory is unlikely.\n\nThe Hunley was the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel in battle, taking down the USS Housatonic with a 135-pound torpedo. It sank on February 17, 1864, and was discovered in 2000. The sub is now on display in North Charleston, South", "answers": ["For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery—and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it. Rachel Lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the Confederate submarine HL Hunley, which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the Union's USS Housatonic sloop with a torpedo, reports a Hakai Magazine article posted at Smithsonian.com. Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN.

If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates. Co-sponsors include Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. But many prominent Democrats are not on board, at least yet, including Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and those in tough re-election fights, reports Politico. The politics: No, this isn't going to pass, \"but here's the big question,\" writes Perry Bacon Jr. at FiveThirtyEight. \"Is it going to become one of the central goals of the Democratic Party and a defining feature of the campaign of whichever Democrat is the party's nominee in 2020?\" As of now, this \"seems very likely,\" as the Democratic party seems to be gravitating to the left. But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit—forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

Three other provisions of the law were struck down, including the \"show me your papers\" provision, which required officers to determine the immigration status of individuals during routine law enforcement stops. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law and the state's inherent authority to protect its people. However, Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion, criticized the Court's decision and suggested that the Framers of the Constitution would have been shocked by the idea that the president could choose not to enforce certain immigration laws.\n\nIn the health care case, the Court upheld the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty, and rejected arguments that the entire Affordable Care Act must be struck down if that provision is unconstitutional. The Court also ruled that the Anti-Injunction Act did not bar the lawsuits challenging the health care reform law. House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans have vowed to repeal the law if it is not completely thrown out.\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio accused President Obama of trying to make him the \"poster boy\" of Arizona's immigration law and vowed to continue enforcing the state's laws, despite the Supreme Court's decision.

In that case, the court ruled that the sender of a text message could potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted.\n\nHowever, it's not a slam-dunk case for anyone who tries to bring a liability claim against the texter. The court also rejected the argument that someone is liable simply because they know the person they are texting is driving. Instead, there must be evidence that the sender knew or had special reason to know that the driver would read the message while driving and would thus be distracted.\n\nThe legal system is starting to take distracted driving seriously, with recent developments such as the \"textalyzer\" legislation in New York and the lawsuit against Snapchat for its speed-measuring feature. Some legal experts believe that these developments could signal a change in thinking regarding distracted driving and help accelerate that change.\n\nIn 2014, there were nearly 3,200 reported deaths and 431,000 injuries from distracted driver incidents in the US. With the increasing use of social media apps and other distractions, the number of actual distracted driver deaths and injuries could be higher than officially reported.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend—who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle—was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin … an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

The study, published in the journal Translational Psychiatry, indicates that there may be evolutionary advantages for men having children later in life. The researchers collected data on 15,000 sets of twins and found that boys with older fathers had higher geek index scores, which were associated with better performance in school, particularly in STEM subjects. The scientists suggest that geekier fathers may be delaying fatherhood due to their extended careers and educational pursuits, and that these traits are inherited. However, the study has limitations, as it did not extend beyond secondary education and future success, and could not verify whether geek traits were associated with things like poor emotional and social functioning. The researchers also noted that the geek effect was only seen in boys and that some of the genes relating to geekiness and autism overlap, suggesting that older fathers may be more likely to have children with autism. The study does not mean that men should delay having children in the hope of having more intelligent sons, as the findings should not be used to guide individual decisions about parenthood.
