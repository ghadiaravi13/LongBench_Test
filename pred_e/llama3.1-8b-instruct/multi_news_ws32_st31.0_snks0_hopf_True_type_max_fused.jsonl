According to Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 17% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. This disparity is costing companies talent and hurting the country's competitiveness.\n\nTo address this issue, companies and schools need to take proactive steps to encourage girls to become leaders. This can be done by introducing girls to female role models, providing sponsorship and support, and making leadership opportunities available. Companies can also use Take Our Children to Work Day to introduce girls to women in top leadership positions and provide them with opportunities to learn from their experiences.\n\nPrinceton University is an example of a successful initiative. The university found that the number of female students winning top academic honors had decreased over the years. To address this issue, the university formed a steering committee to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes. As a result, in 2011, 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars were women.\n\nThe key to success is to provide girls with opportunities to learn from female role models and to provide them with sponsorship and support.

Recently, American explorer Barry Clifford claimed to have found the wreck of the Santa Maria off the coast of Haiti.

The Unesco team has also suggested that the Santa Maria may be buried under the sediment on the ocean floor, rather than being a shipwreck. This theory is based on a passage in Columbus's diary that describes the ship running aground on a reef.

The apparitions were said to have occurred in 1859 when a Belgian immigrant named Adele Brise claimed to have seen Mary three times. The church has deemed the apparitions to be of supernatural origin and has declared them to be worthy of belief. This is the first time in the United States that the church has officially validated apparitions of Mary.\n\nThe chapel, which is located in a rural area, has seen a surge in visitors since the announcement. Many people have come to pray and pay their respects to Mary, and some have reported feeling a sense of peace and comfort in her presence.\n\nThe validation of the apparitions is seen as a positive development for the Catholic Church, which has been embroiled in scandals related to sex abuse. The church's leaders hope that the validation will bring people closer to their faith and provide a sense of hope and healing.\n\nThe process of validating apparitions is a lengthy and rigorous one, involving a thorough investigation by theologians and a review of the evidence. In this case, the church's investigation found that Adele Brise's claims were consistent with her life and actions, and that she had devoted her life to teaching children the faith.\n\nThe validation of the apparitions is also seen as a reminder that God's love is available to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. The fact that Mary appeared to Adele Brise, a simple country girl, is seen as a testament to the church's message of inclusivity and love.\n\nOverall, the validation of the apparitions at Our Lady of Good Help Chapel is a significant development for the Catholic Church and a reminder of the power of faith and devotion.

The CIA has disputed some of the report's findings, and the agency has been accused of monitoring the computers of Senate staff members who worked on the report. The CIA has also been accused of withholding documents from the Senate committee, which has led to a breakdown in relations between the two. The dispute has reached a point where the CIA's Inspector General has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency. The White House has been closely following the dispute, but has not directly intervened. The report's release has been delayed for nearly 15 months, and it is unclear whether it will ever be made public. The dispute has raised questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government, and the limits of congressional oversight of the intelligence community. \n\nKey players in the dispute include Sen.

However, these proteins have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish from freezing but also prevent them from melting the ice that forms inside their bodies. This means that the fish are left with a lifelong accumulation of ice in their veins, which could be detrimental to their health. Researchers have discovered that the antifreeze proteins bind to the ice crystals and prevent them from growing or melting, effectively creating a \"superheated\" state. This phenomenon has been observed in both laboratory experiments and in the wild, where the fish have been found to have ice crystals in their bodies even in the warmer summer months. The researchers believe that the fish may have evolved other mechanisms to deal with the ice accumulation, but the long-term effects of this phenomenon are still unknown. The study highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolutionary adaptations, where seemingly beneficial traits can have unintended consequences. The discovery of superheating in nature has also sparked interest in the scientific community, as it challenges our understanding of the behavior of water and ice in biological systems.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

The tool was discovered below a layer of volcanic ash from Mount St. Helens, which has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The scraper is believed to be one of the oldest artifacts in North America, predating the Clovis culture, which is currently considered the oldest human culture in the Americas.\n\nThe discovery was made possible by the excavation efforts of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, which has been working at the site since 2011. The team has uncovered a number of stone projectile points and tooth fragments from an extinct species of camel. The stone tool was analyzed by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland, which found that it contained blood residue consistent with bison.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the field of archaeology, as it suggests that humans may have occupied the Americas much earlier than previously thought.

{"pred": " \nThe Pacific coast of North America is facing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports dozens of species of seabirds, whales, sharks, and commercially important fish such as salmon. The decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle, overfishing, and the shift of nutrient-rich waters away from the West Coast. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has implemented measures to reduce the catch of sardines, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing to allow the population to recover. The decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect on the ecosystem, with many species of seabirds, sea lions, and other predators struggling to find food. In fact, a recent study found that 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches in 2013, with researchers attributing the scarcity of prey to the decline of sardines. The Pacific sardine population has fluctuated wildly over the years, with a previous collapse in the 1950s and a rebound in the 1980s. However, the current decline is the steepest in generations, with a 72% drop in population since 2006. The long-term consequences of this decline are still unknown, but experts warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years to come if the sardine population does not recover. \n\nKey statistics:\n\n* The Pacific sardine population has declined by 72% since 2006.\n* The population is projected to continue declining.\n* The decline has already had a ripple effect on the ecosystem, with many species struggling to find food.\n* 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches in 2013.\n* The Pacific Fishery Management Council has implemented measures to reduce the catch of sardines.\n* Some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing to allow the population to recover. \n\nRecommendations:\n\n* The Pacific Fishery Management Council should continue to monitor the sardine population and adjust fishing regulations as needed.\n* Environmental groups should be allowed to conduct further research on the impact of fishing on the sardine population.\n* The long-term consequences of the decline of sardines should be studied to inform conservation efforts.\n* The public should be educated about the importance of sardines in the marine ecosystem and the potential consequences of their decline. \n\nNote: The", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

A study by the Humane Research Council (HRC) found that only 2% of the US population is currently vegetarian or vegan, while 10% have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but have since given up. The study suggests that the main reasons for lapsing include transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other vegetarians, and not being able to address food cravings. On the other hand, current vegetarians and vegans have a wide range of motivations, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.\n\nA personal account by a lapsed vegetarian shares a similar experience, where the author had given up meat for over a decade but eventually returned to eating meat after a period of time. The author attributes their decision to a combination of factors, including a desire to eat more pasta and a feeling of being part of a \"man's club\" that excluded vegetarians.\n\nThe study also found that giving up meat is harder than reducing meat consumption, and that a message focused on reduction rather than complete elimination of animal products may be more effective in promoting a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.

Others, like Baseball Joe Veyera, are disappointed to see the intentional walk disappear because it was a fun moment to watch. \n\nHowever, the change may not have a significant impact on the game's pace. According to MLB Statistics, intentional walks took an estimated 35 seconds per game in 2016, and the automatic IBB (intentional base on balls) may not make a big difference. \n\nSome fans have even joked about making the intentional walk more exciting, such as having the center fielder throw the pitches or having a fun dugout signal. \n\nIn related news, MLB is considering eliminating the four pitches required for an intentional walk altogether, with the goal of making the game faster.

However, achieving this goal will require a concerted effort from healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public to reduce the overuse of antibiotics.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked calls for increased transparency and accountability in antibiotic prescribing practices. Some experts have suggested that healthcare providers should be required to report their antibiotic prescribing practices to public health authorities, and that patients should be educated about the risks of antibiotic overuse.\n\nIn addition to the study's findings, there have been several other recent developments in the fight against antibiotic resistance. The Pew Charitable Trusts has released a report highlighting the need for increased transparency and accountability in antibiotic prescribing practices, and the CDC has launched a new initiative to reduce antibiotic resistance.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the need for increased awareness and action to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

{"pred": " \nA recent study by Pecan Street Research has found that solar panels facing west may be more effective at generating electricity than those facing south, which is the conventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere. The study, which analyzed data from 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing panels produced 2% more electricity in a day and 49% more electricity during peak afternoon hours. This is significant because it means that homeowners with west-facing roofs may be able to generate more electricity and reduce their reliance on the grid during peak hours.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the solar industry and utility companies. Currently, many utility companies offer rebates and incentives for homeowners to install solar panels, but these incentives are often tied to the panels facing south. The study suggests that this may not be the most effective way to maximize electricity generation, and that utility companies may need to rethink their policies.\n\nThe study's lead author, Brewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street Research, said that the findings have the potential to \"dramatically change the residential solar market.\" He noted that the study's results are not surprising, given that many solar panel installers have long known that west-facing panels can be more effective, but that utility companies have been slow to adopt this approach.\n\nThe study's findings are also significant because they highlight the importance of testing solar panel performance in practice, rather than relying on theoretical models. As one expert noted, \"it's only one study, but it raises a good point about testing solar panel performance in practice instead of just assuming that angling south is always the way to go.\"\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that solar panels facing west may be a more effective way to generate electricity, and that utility companies and homeowners may need to rethink their approach to solar panel installation. While the study's results are not definitive, they provide valuable insights into the potential of solar energy and highlight the need for further research and testing in this area. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The word count is 400 words, which is the maximum allowed.

A new study suggests that the standard industry advice (at least in this hemisphere) of having the panels face south is wrong, reports National Geographic. Try west instead. The study by the Pecan Street Research Institute in Texas found that homes with west-facing panels generate 2% more electricity per day, with the biggest benefit coming in the late afternoon—generally peak usage time for utilities, notes Gizmodo. \"Quantifying the way that favoring late-day sunlight helps homeowners save money and utilities flatten out demand could lead to a simple but effective hack for the world’s solar installers,\" writes Christopher Mims at Quartz. \"Simply re-orienting solar panels could shorten the amount of time it takes for them to pay for themselves.\" It's just one study, however, and it would be interesting to see whether the results hold up in winter as well as summer, writes Amanda Miller at the Clean Energy Authority.

The Clarion Nightsnake was first spotted by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 on the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast. However, subsequent visits failed to find more snakes, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The only existing sample was assumed to be a labelling error, and the snake was considered extinct. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected that the snake might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, set out to find the snake, using Beebe's original field notes as a guide. They timed their expedition to replicate Beebe's steps and used DNA analysis to establish the snake as its own species. The tests showed that the snake is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sonora coast, more than 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems and the importance of preserving biodiversity. The snake is now recognized as a full species, and conservation efforts are underway to protect it and its habitat.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

Instead of being both a tablet and a laptop, it's \"really just the worst of both worlds.\" It's also hard to use: \"It's just a half-broken death march up the learning curve.\" Over at Wired, Mathew Honan loves the look of the machine, and like others, drools over the satisfying \"snap\" of its razor-thin kickstand. It's durable too, but the cameras lag and \"the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your Razr V3.\" Pretty much everyone hates the Windows RT software the machine runs on. It's a departure from Window's old operating systems—it's colorful and swipe-friendly, for starters. But Harry McCracken, writing for CNN, wonders why the new design still includes a desktop. Switching between the two interfaces \"can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you're teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning.\" The apps are a big letdown, writes David Pogue in the New York Times.

However, the study also found that these correlations were not present in women, and that people were not able to accurately predict a woman's IQ by looking at her face.\n\nThe researchers suggest that this may be because women's faces are more variable and less predictable than men's faces, and that this may be due to the fact that women's faces are more influenced by hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. The study also found that people's perceptions of attractiveness and intelligence are closely linked, and that people tend to find more attractive faces to be more intelligent.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between facial features and intelligence, and suggest that there may be a genetic component to intelligence that is linked to facial features.

The new planet, called Planet 9, is a gas giant that is estimated to be 10 times the size of Earth and has a highly eccentric orbit. It is believed to be located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Neptune.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 was made by a team of astronomers led by Mike Brown, a professor at Caltech. Brown is known for his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status in 2006, and he has been searching for a new ninth planet ever since.\n\nBrown and his team used a combination of observations and computer simulations to identify the new planet. They found that the orbits of several small, icy bodies in the outer solar system were being perturbed by the gravitational pull of a large, unseen planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 has sparked a lot of interest and debate in the scientific community. Some scientists are excited about the possibility of a new planet, while others are skeptical and believe that the evidence is not yet conclusive.\n\nOne of the main arguments against Planet 9 is that it is not a planet in the classical sense. It is a gas giant, and its orbit is highly eccentric, which means that it is not a stable, long-term resident of the solar system.\n\nHowever, Brown and his team believe that Planet 9 is a real planet and that it is an important discovery. They argue that the planet's highly eccentric orbit is a result of its massive size and the gravitational interactions with other objects in the solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 has also sparked a renewed debate about the definition of a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined a planet as a celestial body that orbits the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape, and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nHowever, some scientists argue that this definition is too narrow and that it does not take into account the complexity of the solar system. They believe that Planet 9 should be considered a planet because it meets the first two criteria, even if it has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nThe debate about Planet 9 is ongoing, and it is likely to continue for some time.

The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

The study, which was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, used MRI scans to compare the brains of 25 women before and after pregnancy. The results showed that pregnancy caused changes in 11 areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and emotion. The changes were still present two years after childbirth.\n\nThe study found that the brain changes were not limited to the women who were scanned, but could be predicted by analyzing the MRI scans of the women's brains before pregnancy. This suggests that the brain changes are a result of the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, rather than any other factor.\n\nThe study also found that the brain changes were not seen in first-time fathers, suggesting that the changes are specific to women who are pregnant. The researchers believe that the brain changes may be an adaptation to help women prepare for motherhood, and may be related to the increased emotional sensitivity and empathy that many women experience during pregnancy.\n\nThe study's lead author, Elseline Hoekzema, said that the brain changes may be an important factor in understanding the psychological and emotional changes that women experience during pregnancy and after childbirth.

For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing.

The hearing, which is expected to last four days, is being held by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing began with a protest by Democratic senators, who were arrested for disrupting the proceedings. The protesters were objecting to the nomination of Kavanaugh, who they believe is too conservative and will undermine the rights of women and minorities.\n\nKavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by President Donald Trump to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Trump has praised Kavanaugh as a highly qualified and respected jurist, but Democrats have expressed concerns about his views on issues such as abortion and gun control.\n\nThe hearing began with a statement by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who praised Kavanaugh's qualifications and expressed confidence that he will be confirmed. Grassley also accused Democrats of trying to delay the hearing and block Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\nKavanaugh then delivered a prepared statement, in which he expressed his gratitude for the nomination and his commitment to upholding the Constitution. He also emphasized his independence and impartiality as a judge.\n\nThe hearing then turned to questioning by senators, with Democrats pressing Kavanaugh on his views on issues such as abortion and gun control. Republicans, on the other hand, praised Kavanaugh's qualifications and expressed confidence that he will be confirmed.\n\nThe hearing was marked by several moments of tension, including a confrontation between Senator Kamala Harris and Kavanaugh over his views on abortion. Harris accused Kavanaugh of being \"dishonest\" and \"untruthful\" in his testimony, while Kavanaugh denied the allegations.\n\nThe hearing is expected to continue on Wednesday, with questioning by senators and a panel of experts. The committee is expected to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination later this week, and the full Senate is expected to vote on his confirmation in the coming weeks.\n\nOverall, the hearing was marked by a deep divide between Democrats and Republicans, with each side accusing the other of trying to politicize the process. The outcome of the hearing is far from certain, but it is clear that the nomination of Kavanaugh will be a contentious and closely watched issue in the coming weeks.\n\nKey points:\n\n* The confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh began on Tuesday, September 4, 2018.\n* The hearing was marked by a chaotic and contentious start, with Democratic senators protesting and being arrested.\n* Kavanaugh delivered a prepared statement, in which he expressed his gratitude for the nomination and his commitment to upholding the Constitution.\n* Democrats pressed Kavanaugh on his views on issues", "answers": ["One word keeps showing up in coverage of the first day of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing: \"chaos.\" (See here, here, and here.)

Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time.

The hackathon is a response to the fact that breast pumps are often poorly designed, making it difficult for mothers to express milk comfortably and discreetly.\n\nAccording to a survey, 77% of mothers use breast pumps, but many of them experience discomfort, pain, and embarrassment while using them. The current design of breast pumps is often loud, cumbersome, and difficult to clean, making it a challenge for mothers to express milk in public or in the workplace.\n\nThe hackathon aims to address these issues by bringing together experts from various fields to develop new and innovative solutions.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies.

The study, which was published in the BMJ Open journal, involved 3,432 university students and staff aged 18-40 who had experienced the loss of a friend or family member to suicide. The researchers found that those who had been bereaved by suicide were not only more likely to attempt suicide but also more likely to experience social stigma and difficulties in their daily lives. The study suggests that addressing social stigma and providing support to those who have been bereaved by suicide may be an important way to reduce the risk of suicide attempts. The researchers also found that people who had been bereaved by suicide were more likely to experience difficulties in their daily lives, including dropping out of education or work, and experiencing mental health problems. The study highlights the need for greater support and understanding for those who have been bereaved by suicide, and suggests that addressing social stigma and providing support may be an important way to reduce the risk of suicide attempts. The researchers recommend that employers, educators, and healthcare providers take steps to support those who have been bereaved by suicide, including providing access to counseling and other forms of support. The study also suggests that addressing social stigma and providing support may be an important way to reduce the risk of suicide attempts among young people, who are disproportionately affected by suicide. The researchers note that the study's findings have important implications for suicide prevention and mental health policy, and highlight the need for greater investment in support services for those who have been bereaved by suicide. The study's lead author, Dr. Alexandra Pitman, notes that the study's findings are a reminder that suicide is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to prevention and support.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president’s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation’s intelligence agencies.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4159}

The practice was introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, in the 1840s. Smith received a revelation from God that commanded him to practice plural marriage, and he began to marry multiple women. The practice was initially kept secret, but it eventually became public knowledge and was met with opposition from the government and other churches.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not unique to the Mormons, as it was practiced in other cultures and religions throughout history. However, the Mormons' practice of plural marriage was distinct in that it was based on a divine commandment and was seen as a way to fulfill the commandment to multiply and replenish the earth.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges. Many women were forced into plural marriages against their will, and some men had multiple wives who were not willing to accept the arrangement. The practice also led to social and economic problems, including poverty and inequality.\n\nDespite the challenges, the practice of plural marriage continued until 1890, when the church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a manifesto that officially ended the practice. The manifesto was a response to increasing pressure from the government and other churches, and it marked the beginning of a new era for the church.\n\nToday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not practice plural marriage, and it has officially denounced the practice as a sin. However, the church's history with plural marriage remains an important part of its heritage, and it continues to be a topic of interest and study among historians and scholars.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage had a significant impact on the lives of many women, who were often forced into marriages against their will. Many women suffered physical and emotional abuse, and some were even forced to leave their homes and families. The practice also had a significant impact on the lives of children, who were often raised in households with multiple mothers and fathers.\n\nIn recent years, the church has taken steps to acknowledge and make amends for its past treatment of women in plural marriages. In 2013, the church issued a statement acknowledging the harm caused by the practice of plural marriage and expressing regret for the suffering it caused.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women.

However, the NIC intervened and convinced the university to lift the ban, arguing that fraternities provide valuable opportunities for leadership, community service, and networking.\n\nThe NIC has also been criticized for its handling of hazing incidents. In 2013, a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma was suspended after a pledge was hospitalized due to excessive drinking. The NIC responded by implementing new policies aimed at reducing hazing, but critics argue that these measures are insufficient.\n\nA recent study found that fraternity members are more likely to engage in binge drinking and other high-risk behaviors than non-fraternity members.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

The team has launched a website, wellsreportcontext.com, to publish a rebuttal to the report, which accused quarterback Tom Brady of being aware of the deflated footballs used in the AFC championship game. The rebuttal, written by Patriots lawyer Daniel L. Goldberg, argues that the report's conclusions are based on flawed science and that the NFL's investigation was biased. The report claims that Brady was aware of the deflated footballs and that the team's equipment staff deliberately deflated the balls to gain an unfair advantage. However, the Patriots' rebuttal argues that the deflation of the balls was due to natural causes, such as the cold weather and the type of footballs used, and that there is no evidence to support the claim that Brady was aware of the deflation. The rebuttal also points out that the NFL's investigation was based on incomplete and inaccurate information, and that the league's own rules and procedures were not followed during the investigation.

The reports were based on a series of clues and evidence that suggested Wright was involved in the development of Bitcoin. \n\nOne of the clues was a blog post by Wright in 2008, in which he discussed the idea of a digital currency.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10507}

On August 28, 2015, Gilbert Flores, a 41-year-old man, was shot and killed by police in San Antonio. The incident was captured on video, which shows Flores being shot multiple times by two deputies. The deputies claim that they were in fear for their lives and that Flores was armed with a knife.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage in the community, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in police use of force. The Bexar County Sheriff's Office has launched an investigation into the incident, and the deputies involved have been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated one. In recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents of police use of force in San Antonio, resulting in the deaths of several individuals. According to a report by the San Antonio Express-News, there have been at least 20 incidents of police shootings in the city since 2010, resulting in the deaths of 15 people.\n\nThe report highlights the need for greater accountability and transparency in police use of force, as well as the need for police departments to provide better training and de-escalation techniques to officers. It also notes that the use of force by police is often a complex issue, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nIn addition to the incident involving Gilbert Flores, there have been several other high-profile incidents of police use of force in San Antonio in recent years. These include the shooting of Cedric Howard in 2013, who was shot and killed by police after he allegedly threatened them with a knife; the shooting of Jose Guerra in 2012, who was shot and killed by police after he allegedly pointed a gun at them; and the shooting of Javier Torres in 2011, who was shot and killed by police after he allegedly threatened them with a knife.\n\nThese incidents have sparked outrage and calls for greater accountability and transparency in police use of force. They also highlight the need for police departments to provide better training and de-escalation techniques to officers, as well as the need for greater community engagement and trust-building between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent incident involving Gilbert Flores is just one example of the complex and often contentious issue of police use of force.

Moses calls the whole fiasco Mia's \"vengeful way to pay [Allen] back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\" In a piece written last month, Allen documentarian Robert B.

He has been accused of leaking classified information about the NSA's programs, including the collection of phone records and online data of millions of Americans.\n\nThe US government has welcomed the debate sparked by Snowden's revelations, but has also condemned his actions as a serious breach of national security. President Barack Obama has said that the NSA's programs are necessary to keep the country safe, but has also promised to review the programs to ensure they are not infringing on civil liberties.\n\nSnowden's revelations have sparked a global debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy.

Cruz said that the flag was a \"symbol of heritage\" and that it was up to the people of South Carolina to decide whether to remove it, while Rubio said that the flag was a \"symbol of division\" and that it was time to move on from it. \n\nOther candidates, such as Scott Walker and Carly Fiorina, were more vague in their responses, with Walker saying that he was \"saddened\" by the shooting and Fiorina saying that she was \"heartbroken\" by the tragedy. \n\nThe debate over the Confederate flag has been a contentious issue in South Carolina for years, with many seeing it as a symbol of racism and others seeing it as a symbol of heritage.

In a series of interviews, she called him a \"faker\" and said that she can't imagine what the country would be like with him as president. Trump responded by calling on her to resign, saying that she has \"embarrassed all by her very biased and very dumb statements.\" The controversy has sparked a debate about whether judges should be allowed to make political comments. Some argue that judges should remain neutral and avoid making public statements that could be seen as partisan. Others argue that judges have a right to free speech and should be able to express their opinions. The American Bar Association has weighed in on the issue, saying that judges should avoid making public statements that could be seen as partisan. The ABA's Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judges from engaging in political activity, including making public statements that could be seen as partisan. The code also prohibits judges from using their official position to influence the outcome of an election. The controversy has also raised questions about the role of judges in the political process. Some argue that judges should be seen as impartial arbiters of the law, while others argue that they should be seen as active participants in the political process. The debate is likely to continue, with some arguing that judges should be more outspoken and others arguing that they should remain neutral. The controversy has also sparked a debate about the use of social media by judges. Some argue that judges should be allowed to use social media to express their opinions, while others argue that it is a distraction and should be avoided. The use of social media by judges is a relatively new phenomenon, and there is no clear consensus on how it should be handled.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart.

The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one.

But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect brain activity in four patients with CLIS, allowing them to answer questions and express their thoughts. The patients, who were unable to speak or move, were able to communicate through a device that detected changes in their brain activity. The study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, found that all four patients were able to communicate effectively and even expressed happiness with their lives. This is a significant breakthrough in the field of brain-computer interface technology and has the potential to transform the lives of people with CLIS. The researchers believe that this technology could be used to enable patients to communicate more proactively and even control devices with their thoughts. The study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, said that this technology could be used to \"abolish\" CLIS forever. The study's findings have also sparked interest in the possibility of using fNIRS to communicate with patients who are in a vegetative state.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises.

The allegations against Weinstein date back to the 1990s and include claims of unwanted touching, groping, and rape. Weinstein has denied all allegations, but his reputation has been severely damaged.\n\nIn recent weeks, several women have come forward to share their experiences with Weinstein, including actresses and former employees. The women describe a culture of fear and intimidation at Weinstein's company, where they felt pressured to engage in sexual activities with Weinstein in order to advance their careers.\n\nWeinstein's downfall began in 2015, when a group of investors, led by Lance Maerov, launched a proxy fight to take control of the Weinstein Company. The investors were dissatisfied with Weinstein's leadership and wanted to bring in a new CEO to turn the company around. However, Weinstein fought back, and the investors were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, the investors did manage to pass a code of conduct that would require Weinstein to adhere to certain standards of behavior. The code included provisions that would allow the board of directors to terminate Weinstein's contract if he engaged in any behavior that was deemed unacceptable.\n\nIn 2017, the allegations against Weinstein began to surface, and the board of directors was forced to take action. The board launched an investigation into the allegations and ultimately decided to terminate Weinstein's contract. The decision was made possible by the code of conduct that had been passed in 2015.\n\nWeinstein's departure from the company was followed by a wave of resignations from his loyalists, including his brother Bob Weinstein.

{"pred": " \nThe George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal, also known as Bridgegate, is a U.S. political scandal that occurred in 2013. The scandal involved the closure of several lanes on the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey to New York, causing massive traffic jams. The lane closures were orchestrated by officials in the office of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was a Republican at the time. The scandal led to the resignation of several high-ranking officials, including the governor's deputy chief of staff and the director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nIn recent news, a citizen's complaint against Governor Christie has been allowed to proceed in court. The complaint was filed by a former firefighter and citizen activist, William Brennan, who alleged that Christie's office was involved in the lane closures. The complaint was initially dismissed, but a judge has now ruled that it can proceed. This development has sparked renewed interest in the scandal and has raised questions about Christie's involvement in the lane closures.\n\nThe scandal has been the subject of a federal trial, which began in 2016. The trial has focused on the actions of two former Christie aides, Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly, who were accused of orchestrating the lane closures. The trial has also raised questions about Christie's knowledge of the lane closures and his involvement in the scandal.\n\nIn recent testimony, a former Christie aide, Charlie McKenna, testified that he believed the lane closures were part of a traffic study, even after emails were discovered that suggested otherwise. McKenna's testimony has been seen as an attempt to downplay Christie's involvement in the scandal.\n\nThe scandal has had significant consequences for Christie's career. In 2016, he announced that he would not seek the Republican presidential nomination, citing the scandal as one of the reasons. The scandal has also damaged Christie's reputation and has led to calls for his resignation.\n\nIn related news, a judge has ruled that there is enough evidence to proceed with a criminal complaint against Christie. The complaint was filed by Brennan, who alleged that Christie's office was involved in the lane closures. The judge's ruling has sparked renewed interest in the scandal and has raised questions about Christie's involvement in the lane closures.\n\nThe scandal has also led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in government. Many have criticized Christie's administration for its handling of the scandal and have called for greater oversight of government agencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal is a significant and ongoing scandal that has had significant consequences for Governor Christie's career and reputation", "answers": ["A citizen's official misconduct complaint against New Jersey Gov.

Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling.

Under this system, everyone would be covered by Medicare, and there would be no more private insurance companies. The bill has been met with enthusiasm from progressive activists, who see it as a major step towards achieving universal healthcare. However, the bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, and even some Democrats have expressed concerns about its feasibility.\n\nDespite the challenges, Sanders has been pushing for single-payer healthcare for years, and his bill has gained significant momentum in recent months. A recent poll found that 53% of Americans support a national healthcare plan, and several Democratic senators have come out in support of the bill. Sanders has also been touring the country, holding town halls and rallies to build support for the bill.\n\nThe bill would cover a wide range of healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. It would also cover long-term care, such as nursing home care, and mental health services. The bill would be funded through a combination of taxes and savings from reducing administrative costs.\n\nWhile the bill has its supporters, it also has its critics. Some have expressed concerns about the cost of the bill, which is estimated to be around $32 trillion over 10 years. Others have expressed concerns about the impact on small businesses and the self-employed, who would be required to pay higher taxes to fund the bill.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sanders remains committed to his goal of achieving universal healthcare.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment.

Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal.

Despite his experience as governor and his family's political legacy, Bush was unable to gain traction in the Republican primary.\n\nBush's campaign was also hurt by his decision to focus on policy issues, rather than appealing to voters' emotions.

Additionally, Bush's campaign was plagued by internal conflicts and a lack of cohesion, which made it difficult for him to present a united front to voters.\n\nBush's decision to run for president was seen as a long shot from the beginning, and his campaign was always at a disadvantage due to his family's legacy and the strong field of Republican candidates.

The report reveals that the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio in the US is 312:1, with some CEOs earning as much as 1,000 times more than their workers. The report also found that the pay gap between CEOs and workers has grown significantly since the 1970s, with CEOs now earning 312 times more than workers, up from 20 times more in 1965.\n\nThe report highlights the case of McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook, who earned $21.6 million in 2017, while the median worker at McDonald’s earned just $19,000. Similarly, Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos earned $81.8 million in 2017, while the median worker at Amazon earned just $28,000.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is not limited to the tech industry. In fact, the pay gap is even wider in industries such as finance and healthcare, where CEOs earn significantly more than workers.\n\nThe report suggests that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is driven by a number of factors, including the increasing use of stock options and other forms of executive compensation that are tied to the performance of the company. The report also notes that the pay gap is exacerbated by the fact that CEOs are often able to negotiate their own compensation packages, which can lead to inflated pay.\n\nThe report concludes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is a major issue in the US, and that it has significant implications for the economy and society as a whole. The report suggests that policymakers should consider implementing policies to address the pay gap, such as increasing taxes on high-income earners or implementing stricter regulations on executive compensation.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of transparency in executive compensation, and notes that the new SEC rule requiring companies to disclose the ratio of CEO-to-worker pay is an important step in increasing transparency. The report suggests that this rule will help to shed light on the pay gap between CEOs and workers, and will provide policymakers with the information they need to make informed decisions about how to address the issue.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the pay gap between CEOs and workers in the US, and highlights the need for policymakers to take action to address this issue.

The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
