It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

Vaccination is a safe and effective way to protect against measles, and it is recommended that all children receive two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, starting at 12 to 15 months of age.\n\nIn addition to the MMR vaccine, there are several other vaccines that are recommended for children, including the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine. These vaccines are all recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are an important part of protecting children from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.\n\nIt's worth noting that while vaccines are safe and effective, they are not 100% effective.

The proposal, which is still in its early stages, aims to discourage smoking and reduce the number of smokers in the country. The price hike is expected to be substantial, with some estimates suggesting that a pack of cigarettes could cost up to $40. The government believes that this increase will help to reduce the number of smokers and ultimately lead to a healthier population.\n\nHowever, not everyone is in favor of the proposal. Some argue that it will disproportionately affect low-income smokers, who may not be able to afford the increased cost of cigarettes. Others believe that it will lead to a black market for cigarettes, where people will continue to buy and sell cigarettes at lower prices.\n\nThe government is also considering introducing plain packaging for cigarettes, which would require manufacturers to remove all branding and logos from cigarette packs. This is aimed at making cigarettes less appealing to young people and reducing the number of smokers.\n\nIn addition to these measures, the government is also considering introducing a tax on e-cigarettes. This would be a significant increase in the cost of e-cigarettes, which are already subject to a tax. The tax would be aimed at reducing the number of people who use e-cigarettes and encourage them to switch to other nicotine-free products.\n\nThe government is also considering introducing a ban on the sale of flavored e-liquids.

The loss of the sardine population is also affecting the livelihoods of people who depend on the fish for food and income.\n\nThe decline of the sardine population is attributed to a combination of factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Overfishing has led to the depletion of the sardine population, while habitat destruction has reduced the availability of food and shelter for the fish. Climate change has also affected the distribution and abundance of the sardines, making it difficult for them to survive.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the sardine population and restore the marine ecosystem.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing).

If left unchecked, it could lead to the loss of effective treatments for common infections, making even minor injuries life-threatening. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development.\n\nTo combat antibiotic resistance, the WHO recommends a range of strategies, including:\n\n1.  **Improving infection prevention and control practices**: This includes proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and proper disposal of medical waste.\n2.  **Optimizing antibiotic use**: This includes prescribing antibiotics only when necessary, using the right antibiotic for the right infection, and completing the full course of treatment.\n3.  **Strengthening laboratory capacity**: This includes improving laboratory testing and surveillance to detect antibiotic resistance.\n4.  **Promoting awareness and education**: This includes educating healthcare workers, patients, and the general public about the risks of antibiotic resistance and the importance of responsible antibiotic use.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, we can slow the spread of antibiotic resistance and preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations. It is a global effort that requires the collaboration of governments, healthcare providers, researchers, and the public to combat this growing public health threat. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   World Health Organization (WHO)\n*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n*   National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\n*   American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) \n*   American Medical Association (AMA) \n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n*   [Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2019", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study suggested that this is because the 30-degree angle allows for more sunlight to hit the panels.\n\nIn addition to the direction and angle of the solar panel, the type of panel used can also affect its efficiency. Monocrystalline solar panels are generally more efficient than polycrystalline solar panels. This is because monocrystalline panels have a higher concentration of silicon, which allows them to convert more sunlight into electricity.\n\nIn conclusion, the direction and angle of solar panels, as well as the type of panel used, can all impact their efficiency. By choosing the right direction and angle for your solar panels, and selecting the most efficient type of panel, you can maximize your energy output and save money on your electricity bill.\n\n**Solar Panel Efficiency: A Guide to Maximizing Your Energy Output**\n\nWhen it comes to solar panels, efficiency is key. The direction and angle of your solar panels can greatly impact their ability to generate electricity. Here are some tips to help you maximize your energy output:\n\n1.  **Face your solar panels towards the sun**: This may seem obvious, but it's essential to ensure your solar panels are facing the direction of the sun. In the northern hemisphere, this means facing them south, while in the southern hemisphere, they should face north.\n2.  **Adjust the angle**: The ideal angle for solar panels is between 30° and 40°. This allows them to capture the", "answers": ["If you happen to have solar panels on your house, they might need a change of direction.

{"pred": " NEW YORK, NY - A recent study published in the Journal of Medical Research has found that a common procedure used to treat early-stage breast cancer may not be as effective as previously thought. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at a leading medical institution, found that the procedure, known as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), may not be necessary for all patients with early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe study, which was published in a leading medical journal, found that patients who underwent ALND had a higher risk of complications and a lower quality of life compared to those who did not undergo the procedure. The study's findings suggest that ALND may not be necessary for all patients with early-stage breast cancer, and that alternative treatments, such as radiation therapy or hormone therapy, may be just as effective.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for patients with early-stage breast cancer, and highlight the need for more personalized treatment approaches.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, found that women who consumed more potatoes were more likely to develop insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes. The study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked high potato consumption to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal Diabetes Care, analyzed data from over 150,000 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II. The researchers found that women who consumed more potatoes had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for other factors such as age, body mass index, and physical activity.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Frank Hu, said that the findings suggest that potatoes may be a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. \"Our study suggests that potatoes may be a more significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes than previously thought,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers also found that women who consumed more potatoes had a higher risk of developing insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked high potato consumption to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Potatoes are a starchy food that can cause a spike in blood sugar levels, which can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with other research that has shown that a diet high in potatoes and other starchy vegetables can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The team notes, however, that the study shows correlation, not causation, and says more research is needed.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

{"pred": " \nA recent study has found that people can predict intelligence by looking at a person's face. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers, used a machine learning algorithm to analyze the facial features of over 1,000 people and found that certain facial features, such as the shape of the eyes and the size of the nose, are associated with higher intelligence. The study's findings suggest that it may be possible to use facial recognition technology to identify people who are more likely to be intelligent.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced by the study's findings. Some experts have questioned the methodology used in the study and have pointed out that there are many other factors that can influence a person's intelligence, such as education and socio-economic status. They have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of facial recognition technology, particularly in the context of employment and education.\n\nIn related news, a new study has found that people who are more intelligent tend to have more symmetrical faces. The study, which was published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, found that people with more symmetrical faces were more likely to have higher IQs and better cognitive abilities. The researchers suggest that this may be because symmetrical faces are associated with good health and high social status, and that people who are more intelligent may be more likely to have these characteristics.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are many other factors that can influence a person's intelligence, and that facial symmetry is just one of many possible indicators. Additionally, there are many people who are intelligent but do not have symmetrical faces, and vice versa.\n\nIn conclusion, while facial symmetry may be associated with higher intelligence, it is not a definitive indicator of a person's cognitive abilities. There are many other factors that can influence a person's intelligence, and it is not possible to accurately predict a person's intelligence based solely on their facial features.\n\nHere are some other possible indicators of intelligence:\n\n*   **Education**: People who have pursued higher education tend to have higher IQs and better cognitive abilities.\n*   **Career**: Certain careers, such as those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), often require high levels of intelligence and cognitive ability.\n*   **Achievements**: People who have achieved great things, such as winning awards or making significant contributions to their field, are often highly intelligent.\n*   **Problem-solving skills**: The ability to solve complex problems and think critically is a key indicator of intelligence.\n*   **Creativity**: Highly intelligent people often have a high level of creativity and", "answers": ["It's easier to guess men's intelligence than women's just by looking at their faces—maybe because we're so distracted by female beauty, according to a new study.

LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

{"pred": " \nA recent study has found that pregnancy affects the brain in various ways. The study, which was conducted on 25 women, found that pregnancy changes the brain's structure and function, particularly in areas related to emotion, motivation, and memory. The researchers used MRI scans to examine the brains of the women before and after pregnancy, and found that the changes were most pronounced in the amygdala, a region of the brain involved in emotion regulation. The study suggests that pregnancy may have a lasting impact on the brain, and that these changes may be related to the emotional and behavioral changes that many women experience during and after pregnancy.\n\nThe study found that the changes in the brain were most pronounced in the amygdala, a region that plays a key role in emotion regulation. The amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anxiety, and stress, and it is also involved in the formation of emotional memories. The study found that the amygdala was more active in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women, and that this increased activity was associated with changes in emotional processing and memory.\n\nThe study also found that the changes in the brain were not limited to the amygdala, but also affected other regions, including the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision-making and planning, while the hippocampus is involved in memory formation. The researchers found that these regions were also more active in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women.\n\nThe study suggests that the changes in brain activity during pregnancy may be related to the hormonal changes that occur during this time. The levels of estrogen and progesterone, two hormones that play a crucial role in pregnancy, increase significantly during pregnancy. These hormones have been shown to affect brain activity and may contribute to the changes in brain function that occur during pregnancy.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of the effects of pregnancy on the brain and may have implications for the treatment of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, which are common during pregnancy. The study's findings also highlight the importance of considering the effects of pregnancy on the brain when developing treatments for mood disorders.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. [Name], said, \"Our study provides new insights into the effects of pregnancy on the brain and highlights the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying mood changes during pregnancy. By understanding these changes, we may be able to develop more effective treatments for mood disorders during pregnancy and postpartum.\"\n\nThe study's findings were published in the", "answers": ["Pregnancy affects not only a woman's body: It changes parts of her brain, too, a new study published in Nature Neuroscience says. The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

{"pred": " \nThe universe is expanding at an alarming rate, and the latest news suggests that the universe is accelerating its expansion. According to a recent study, the universe is expanding at a rate of 7% per billion years, which is faster than previously thought. This means that the universe is getting bigger and bigger, and the distances between galaxies are increasing.\n\nThe implications of this are profound. As the universe expands, the light from distant galaxies will become dimmer and dimmer, making it harder for us to see them. Eventually, the universe will become so vast that it will be impossible for us to see any galaxies beyond a certain distance. This is known as the \"cosmic horizon.\"\n\nThe acceleration of the universe's expansion is a mystery that has puzzled scientists for decades. It is thought to be caused by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which makes up about 68% of the universe's total energy density. Dark energy is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, but its nature and properties are still not well understood.\n\nThe discovery of dark energy has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It suggests that the universe is not only expanding, but it is also accelerating its expansion. This means that the distance between galaxies is increasing, and the universe is becoming less dense.\n\nThe discovery of dark energy has also led to a re-evaluation of the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began as a single point and expanded rapidly around 13.8 billion years ago. However, the discovery of dark energy suggests that the universe may have undergone a period of rapid expansion in the distant past, which could have been triggered by a mysterious form of energy.\n\nThe discovery of dark energy has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It suggests that the universe may be much larger and more complex than we previously thought, and that there may be many more galaxies and stars beyond what we can see. It also raises questions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and how they interact with each other.\n\nThe discovery of dark energy has also led to a new area of research, known as cosmology, which is the study of the origin, evolution, and fate of the universe. Cosmologists use a variety of techniques, including observations of distant galaxies and galaxy clusters, to study the properties of dark energy and its role in the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of dark energy has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, and has led to a new era of research and exploration.", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number—and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties—then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.
