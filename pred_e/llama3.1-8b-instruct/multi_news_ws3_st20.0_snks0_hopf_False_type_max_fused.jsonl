Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., was a major benefactor of Jewish causes, but he was also deeply influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington and the racial-equality teachings of his rabbi, Emil Hirsch. He became a funder of Washington's Tuskegee University in Alabama and helped build over 5,300 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South, known as Rosenwald schools. These schools were a crucial part of African-American education, as segregation prohibited blacks from attending all-white schools in many Southern states. The Rosenwald Fund, which was established by Rosenwald, was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century, supporting promising black artists and helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. Rosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on the lives of thousands of African-American children, including civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, poet Maya Angelou, and civil rights leader Julian Bond. The documentary, which is set to be released in mid-August, aims to celebrate the affinity between African-Americans and Jews and to motivate others to continue Rosenwald's tradition of philanthropy. Rosenwald's story is an inspiring one, showing that even the most unlikely individuals can make a significant difference in the lives of others. As civil rights leader Julian Bond notes, \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist, who did not have to care about black people but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America.\" Rosenwald's legacy continues to inspire and educate people today, and his story serves as a reminder of the power of philanthropy and the importance of giving back to one's community.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.

In Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on an \"ambition gap.\" \n\nTo address this issue, companies can introduce girls to female role models, explain what leaders do, and support programs that identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to women at the highest level of the company can make a huge difference. Companies can also highlight the accomplishments of these leaders to give them more visibility. \n\nGirls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. They need to know the specific requirements and rewards of leadership, so they can make better choices about their own careers. Companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. \n\nThe Princeton University example shows that encouragement from influential people can make a difference. The university found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade. However, after the faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, the number of female Rhodes Scholars increased to 3 out of 4 in 2011. \n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key.

However, many consumers reported that their Hatchimals did not hatch, despite following the instructions.\n\nA class-action lawsuit has been filed against Spin Master, the manufacturer of the toy, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive business practices and misrepresented the toy's capabilities. The lawsuit claims that Spin Master knew that the hatching was a key feature of the toy and that it was a major draw for consumers. However, the company failed to ensure that the toy worked as advertised, leading to widespread disappointment and frustration.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Spin Master engaged in a \"bait and switch\" marketing scheme, where the company created a sense of urgency and scarcity around the toy, leading consumers to pay inflated prices for the toy. The lawsuit claims that Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits from the toy, but that the failure rate was exceptionally high.\n\nSpin Master has responded to the lawsuit, stating that the company stands behind its products and cares about its consumers. However, the company has also acknowledged that it experienced a higher than anticipated number of consumer calls over the holiday period and that it provided troubleshooting support and replacement products for those who experienced issues with their toys.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

The lawsuit, filed by Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, Calif., on behalf of what the suit says could be millions of consumers, claims Spin Master ran \"a bait-and-switch marketing scheme.\" Hatchimals are plush animals stuffed into plastic eggs that, when the egg is rubbed and cuddled for about half an hour, should begin to peck their way out.

Recently, US marine archaeologist Barry Clifford announced that he had found the wreck of the Santa Maria off the coast of Haiti. However, experts from the UN's cultural body Unesco have disputed this claim, saying that the wreck is not from the 15th or 16th century, but rather from a much later period. They based their conclusion on the type of fasteners found at the site, which are made of copper alloy, whereas the Santa Maria would have had iron and/or wood fixations.\n\nUnesco has now announced that it will look for the Santa Maria in several locations, including coastal marshland, where it believes the ship may be buried under sediment. However, this decision has been met with criticism from scholars, who argue that Columbus's vessel could not have reached the marshland due to shallow and dangerous reefs.\n\nA senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker, has been refused permission to continue his work on the site, and a partly European team has been brought in to replace him. Unesco has also advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team's proposal, citing concerns about the protection of underwater cultural heritage.\n\nDespite the controversy, Professor Beeker remains confident that Clifford's site is the best candidate yet proposed for the wreck of the Santa Maria. He argues that the bronze fasteners found at the site are not sufficient reason to dismiss it without further investigation, and that there are possible explanations for their presence.\n\nThe search for the Santa Maria has sparked renewed international interest in finding Columbus's lost flagship, which represented the start of continuous contact between the old and new worlds. Barry Clifford has called for Unesco to investigate the entire area where the lombard cannons were found, which he believes are the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria. \n\nOverall, the search for the Santa Maria remains a complex and contentious issue, with different experts and organizations having different opinions on the matter.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

The team has transplanted wombs into nine women, with four of them now having embryos transferred into their new wombs. The wombs were donated by the women's mothers or other close relatives, a technique that is considered controversial. \n\nThe women who received the transplants had in vitro fertilization (IVF) before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. Dr. Brannstrom predicts that three or four of the women might successfully give birth, while one or two might get pregnant but miscarry, and one or two might not be able to get pregnant. \n\nThe transplants are intended to benefit women who are unable to have children due to the loss of their uterus. The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ, and they will be monitored closely for any complications. \n\nThe Swedish team's technique is different from other womb transplant attempts, which have used wombs from dead donors. However, experts have raised concerns about the risks of the operation for the donor, particularly if large chunks of blood vessels have to be removed. \n\nDr. Brannstrom's team has already reported \"mild rejection episodes\" in four patients, and two patients had to have their wombs removed due to complications.

The report also shows that the techniques didn't provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. \n\nThe CIA has disputed some of the report's findings, and the agency has been accused of monitoring computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study, which may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency.

However, these proteins have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent ice from forming but also inhibit it from melting. This means that the fish are left with ice crystals in their bodies, which can be detrimental to their health. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the ice crystals do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead remain intact even at temperatures above 30 degrees Fahrenheit. The researchers also found that the ice crystals are primarily located in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter them out of the blood. The study suggests that the antifreeze proteins may have a long-term cost for the fish, and that further research is needed to understand the effects of this phenomenon.

Turns out at least some of them don't.

The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

Mahler, who is the son of a retired rabbi, said that he did not see evil in Bowers' eyes, but rather confusion and a lack of depth. He speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. Mahler said that he treated Bowers with compassion and empathy, and that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. Bowers, on the other hand, yelled \"Death to all Jews\" as he was wheeled into the emergency room. Mahler's father, Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, is a retired rabbi who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Mahler grew up experiencing anti-Semitism, and said that he often found swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. He developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites, including telling people that he isn't very religious. Mahler worked as a financial consultant before becoming a nurse, and he has been working at Allegheny General Hospital since March 2018. He concluded his Facebook post with a plea for love in the face of evil, saying that love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings. Dr. Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that Mahler came to him in tears after treating Bowers, and that he was proud of Mahler for doing his job. Cohen also described Bowers as \"lost\" and said that he wanted to see him with his own eyes to understand how someone could commit such a heinous act.

The site, which has been excavated since 2011, has yielded evidence of one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States. A small stone tool, believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood, was found below a layer of volcanic ash that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The tool, made from orange agate, was discovered by Scott Thomas, a Bureau of Land Management archaeologist, who noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow and sage brush growing in front of it. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating that someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there.\n\nThe tool was found to have blood residue consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. The discovery has sparked excitement in the archaeological community, with some experts suggesting that it could be one of the oldest artifacts in North America. However, the find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, and experts are urging caution until more evidence is gathered.\n\nThe Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is located near the site of the Paisley Cave, which is currently considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence. The discovery at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter has the potential to challenge this assumption and provide new insights into the history of human occupation in the western United States.\n\nThe University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers, and volunteers invaluable field experience.

The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline has raised concerns about the impact on the West Coast ecosystem, as sardines are a crucial food source for many species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has been urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe decline has also had a significant impact on the fishing industry, with fishermen struggling to catch sardines. A recent fishing trip off the coast of California resulted in no catches, with the captain stating that the decline is \"pretty reflective of how things have been going.\" The decline is attributed to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines.\n\nThe effects of the decline are likely to be felt for years to come, with experts warning that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer. The Pacific sardine is considered a boom-bust fish, with its numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. However, the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century.\n\nScientists are still unsure of the exact cause of the decline, but research suggests that overfishing may not be the primary factor. The West Coast's sardine population is considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, and the current decline may be more related to ocean conditions. The decline has also highlighted the importance of forage fish, such as sardines, in the ocean food web, and the need to protect these species to maintain a healthy ecosystem. \n\nIn response to the decline, the Pacific Fishery Management Council has implemented steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, but some environmental groups have argued that the catch should be halted outright. The conservation group Oceana has stated that continuing to fish for sardines at this low population level could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. \n\nOverall, the decline of the Pacific s", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein—that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1889}

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that if the Justice Department does not appoint a special prosecutor to take over the investigation, it will indicate that Comey’s firing was “part of a cover up.” Schumer also expressed fears that the decision would create a chilling effect for the next FBI director, who could fear getting fired if they “run afoul of the administration.”\n\nThe firing of Comey has sparked a wave of reactions from politicians and experts. Many Democrats have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to take over the investigation, while Republicans have insisted that one is not needed.

{"pred": " \nA recent study by Pecan Street Research Institute has found that solar panels facing west may be more effective at generating electricity than those facing south, which is the conventional wisdom in the northern hemisphere. The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity in a day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm. This is a significant finding, as it could change the way solar panels are installed and used in the future.\n\nThe study found that west-facing solar panels reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels. This is a major advantage, as it could help reduce stress on utility grids during peak demand periods.\n\nThe study's findings are not surprising, as some solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while. However, utility companies have traditionally recommended a south orientation for solar panels, and have refused to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south.\n\nThe study's lead author, Brewster McCracken, hopes that the findings will prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. He notes that west-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which is when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer.\n\nThe study's findings have implications beyond single homes, as they could lead to more efficient use of solar energy and reduced stress on utility grids. However, it's worth noting that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would translate to other seasons.\n\nOverall, the study's findings are a significant development in the field of solar energy, and could lead to changes in the way solar panels are installed and used in the future.

The lake, which existed about 3.7 billion years ago, was a freshwater lake that likely covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater. The rover has also found that early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time, and that water once flowed on many parts of the planet.

Researchers used 3D computer tomography to examine his teeth and found that he had a broken molar and a discolored front tooth. The study suggests that Ötzi's diet, which included coarse grain and gruel, may have contributed to his dental problems. This is not surprising, as the researchers found that the frequency of cavities increased in teeth from the late Stone Age, a time when humans began to incorporate more starches into their diets.\n\nIn addition to his dental problems, Ötzi's genome has been sequenced, revealing more about his life and ancestry. The study found that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition that is currently believed to be caused by factors such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. However, Ötzi was a hunter-gatherer and did not have any of these risk factors, suggesting that we may be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we thought.\n\nThe genome analysis also revealed that Ötzi's paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era. This suggests that Ötzi's ancestors may have been part of a small population that migrated to Europe, and that his genetic profile is most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia.\n\nThe study also found that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease, which was discovered in his genome. The study suggests that Lyme disease has plagued humans for thousands of years, and that Ötzi's genome may hold the key to understanding how the disease evolves.\n\nOverall, the study provides a wealth of new information about Ötzi and his life, and sheds light on the lives of our ancient ancestors.

The Clarion Nightsnake was first spotted by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 on the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast. However, subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error, and the snake was largely forgotten. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. They used Beebe's original field notes as a guide and replicated his steps to find the snake. One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. DNA analysis confirmed that the snake is a distinct species and is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The re-discovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems.

{"pred": " Russell Armstrong, the estranged husband of Taylor Armstrong from the reality TV show \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" was found dead in his home in Los Angeles on Monday night. The cause of death is believed to be suicide, although an autopsy will be performed to confirm. Armstrong, 47, had been struggling with financial difficulties and a troubled marriage, which was documented on the show. His wife, Taylor, had filed for divorce in July, citing irreconcilable differences, and had accused him of physical abuse. Armstrong had denied the allegations, but had admitted to being emotionally vulnerable and feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of being on the show. In a statement, Taylor Armstrong said she was \"devastated\" by her husband's death and requested privacy to comfort their daughter. The couple's relationship had been rocky, with Armstrong often appearing distant and unaffectionate on the show. In an interview with People magazine, Armstrong had said that the show had \"pushed us to the limit\" and that he had been working 80-hour weeks, which had taken a toll on their relationship. Armstrong had also been facing financial difficulties, including a $1.5 million lawsuit filed against him and his wife for allegedly diverting investors' money to redecorate a Bel-Air mansion. A friend of Armstrong's, Tom Vickers, said that he had broken down just days before his death and admitted that reality TV had destroyed his life. Vickers said that Armstrong had told him that he was too emotional to speak out about the allegations of abuse and that he hoped people would be kind to him when he was ready to speak. Armstrong's attorney, Ronald Richards, said that his client had been struggling with depression and that the pressures of being on the show had taken a toll on his mental health. Richards also said that Armstrong had been forced to support his wife's \"brand\" on the show, which had put a strain on their relationship. The second season of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" is set to premiere on September 5, but it is unclear how the show will deal with the tragedy. Bravo, the network that airs the show, has released a statement expressing sympathy for the Armstrong family. The show's producers have also been criticized for their handling of the couple's relationship and the allegations of abuse.

Sources say the show pressured the Armstrongs to live beyond their means—they were actually millions in debt and being sued by investors—and also pressured them to ramp up the drama in their relationship. Radar reports that Armstrong told a friend, days before his death, that reality TV had ruined his \"entire life.\" But Armstrong's ex-wife blames estranged wife Taylor, from whom Armstrong was getting divorced. \"She's bad news and she drove him into this,\" the ex tells Radar. \"I don't think it was the show.

As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

Anders, a 6'6\" forward, was a key member of the team and was known for his athleticism, flair, and charismatic personality. He was a hero to many fans and was often referred to as the \"Outlaw\" due to his unconventional behavior and style.\n\nAnders disappeared from public view in the late 1980s, and his whereabouts were unknown for many years. Various rumors circulated about his disappearance, including claims that he was living in the Philippines, Switzerland, or Swaziland, or that he had undergone facial reconstruction surgery to avoid recognition.

Anders has been paid for his appearance in the documentary, which is expected to air on ESPN Films later this fall. In the documentary, Anders is seen wearing a pink tuxedo and is quoted as saying, \"A brotherly love is a very powerful thing.\"\n\nAnders' disappearance was a mystery that had confounded many people, including his former teammates and family members. However, it appears that he has been living a quiet life in the Detroit area, and his reappearance has brought back memories of the Phi Slama Jama team's glory days.

{"pred": " \nThe smell of death is a unique phenomenon that has been studied extensively in recent years. Researchers have identified a specific chemical cocktail that is released by decomposing human bodies, which can be used to train cadaver dogs and develop machines that can detect human remains. The cocktail consists of a combination of eight compounds, including diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, 3-methylthio-1-propanol, pyridine, ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate, and ethyl pentanoate. These compounds are released during the decomposition process and can be detected in the headspace of the decomposing remains.\n\nA study published in PLOS ONE found that the combination of these eight compounds can be used to distinguish human remains from other animal remains, including pig remains. The study used a thermal desorber combined with a gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition. The researchers found that the combination of these compounds can be used to separate human and pig remains from other animal remains.\n\nThe study also found that the decomposition process can be influenced by many environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and submersion of the body. However, the researchers were able to standardize the methodology by using glass jars in a laboratory environment to pre-concentrate and sample the released VOCs.\n\nThe findings of this study have important implications for forensic science and disaster victim identification. Cadaver dogs are currently trained to detect nonspecific compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, but the use of a specific chemical cocktail could improve their accuracy. Additionally, the development of machines that can detect human remains using this cocktail could be useful in search and rescue operations.\n\nIn related news, a study published in 2010 found that pigs and humans share similar biological characteristics, including gut flora and body fat percentage, which makes them useful analogues for studying human decomposition. The study used tissue samples and organs from six autopsied corpses and found that pigs and humans share many similarities in their decomposition process.\n\nAnother study published in 2004 found that the decomposition process can be influenced by many environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and soil type.

Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds—called esters—were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports.

{"pred": " \nThe news reports on the alarming rate of ice melting in Antarctica. According to a study released in the journal Nature, the continent has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992, which is enough to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet. This ice loss has made global oceans rise by about three-tenths of an inch. The study found that the melt rate increased from 84 billion tons per year between 1992 and 2011 to 241 billion tons per year between 2012 and 2017. The researchers used 24 different methods to assess ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, said that the ice sheet is losing ice at an alarming rate and that there are no other plausible signals driving this change other than climate change. He also warned that the ice sheet is unlikely to lose ice under natural conditions. The researchers found that the majority of the recent melt is in West Antarctica, where the ice sheet is in a state of collapse. East Antarctica, on the other hand, is losing relatively little ice per year, but scientists are not comfortable saying that this trend will continue.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for sea level rise. Shepherd estimated that Antarctica alone could add about half a foot to sea level rise by the end of the century. The researchers also noted that the melting of land glaciers elsewhere, Greenland's dwindling ice sheet, and the expansion of warmer water are also contributing to sea level rise.\n\nThe study's results are consistent with other research on the topic. A separate study found that East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now. This suggests that the current ice loss in East Antarctica is likely due to climate change.\n\nOverall, the study's findings are a wake-up call for the need to address climate change. The researchers emphasized that the forces driving the changes in Antarctica are not going to get any better in a warming climate. As one of the study's co-authors, Ian Joughin, said, \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate.\" However, the situation is dire, and urgent action is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change. \n\nReferences:\n1. Fretwell, P. et al.

The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"—and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they’re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that’s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it’s the area that we’re most worried about, because it’s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

The Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada covers 300,000 acres and protects a scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. The designations were made using the Antiquities Act, which allows a president to create monuments without congressional approval. The move was seen as a victory for Native American tribes and conservationists, but was opposed by state Republican leaders and many rural residents who said it would add another layer of unnecessary federal control and close the area to new energy development.\n\nHowever, on February 9, 2017, President Donald Trump signed two presidential proclamations that shrunk the size of the Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by roughly 45%. The proclamations split the two national monuments into several smaller sections. The move was seen as a victory for Trump and his supporters, who had long opposed the designations, but was met with opposition from environmentalists and Native American tribes.\n\nThe controversy over the monuments has been ongoing for years, with environmentalists and Native American tribes pushing for protection of the land and state Republican leaders and rural residents opposing the designations.

The number of climbers on the mountain has increased significantly in recent years, and the conditions on the mountain have become increasingly unstable due to climate change.\n\nThe Himalayan Experience (Himex) team, led by Russell Brice, was the first to cancel their climb due to the unstable conditions on the mountain. Brice's decision was seen as a prudent one, given the risks involved, but it was also criticized by some who felt that he was overreacting.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the safety of the Sherpas who work on the mountain. The Sherpas are responsible for carrying heavy loads and setting up the ropes and anchors on the mountain, which puts them at a higher risk of injury or death. The Sherpas are also not provided with the same level of oxygen and medical care as the Western climbers, which makes their job even more hazardous.\n\nThe Nepali government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with many feeling that it has not done enough to protect the Sherpas.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The study, conducted by researchers from the Czech Republic, used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. The results showed that people were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs, but not women. The study also found that the perception of intelligence was associated with certain facial traits, such as a longer face, a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, and a sharper chin. However, these facial traits were not correlated with actual IQ scores.\n\nThe study suggests that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of others is an important aspect of everyday social interaction and has significant evolutionary consequences. The researchers propose several explanations for why people can predict men's intelligence but not women's, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and only apparent in men's faces.\n\nAnother study published in the journal PLoS One found that people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence, but these traits do not actually correlate with real intelligence. The study found that faces perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, and a sharper chin, while faces perceived as less intelligent are broader and more rounded.

However, in 1998, Jon Stewart took over as the host, bringing a new direction to the show. Stewart's vision was to make the show more pointed and purposeful, focusing on politicians and the media. He wanted to create a show that was not just about making fun of people, but also about holding them accountable.\n\nInitially, Stewart faced resistance from the writers and producers who were used to the show's previous format. They felt that Stewart's new direction was too edgy and provocative. However, Stewart persisted, and the show began to take shape. The correspondents, including Steve Carell, Mo Rocca, and Nancy Walls Carell, developed their characters and began to tackle more serious topics.\n\nOne of the breakthrough moments for the show came in 1999 when Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a question on his bus during the presidential primaries. The question, which was pulled from Time magazine, was about McCain's record on pork-barrel politics. The question was met with silence, and Carell was eventually kicked off the bus. However, the moment marked a turning point for the show, as it began to focus more on deconstructing the process of politics and the media.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, The Daily Show became known for its irreverent and satirical take on current events. The show's correspondents became known for their ability to ask tough questions and push politicians to go off-book. The show's success was not limited to its ratings, but also to its influence on the media and politics. The Daily Show's impact was felt in the way it covered the 2000 presidential campaign, and its influence can still be seen today.\n\nIn conclusion, The Daily Show's history is a testament to the power of satire and the importance of holding those in power accountable.

The planet is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of the Earth and is thought to be an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas. It is believed to be located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Pluto, and takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to circle the sun. The discovery was made by Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, who used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet. They have not observed the planet directly, but have seen its gravitational influence on the motion of other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed interest in the debate over Pluto's status as a planet. Pluto was demoted from its status as a planet in 2006, and many scientists argue that it should be reinstated. However, Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, a dwarf planet that helped lead to Pluto's demotion, argues that Pluto is not a planet and should not be reinstated. He believes that the International Astronomical Union's definition of a planet, which requires that a planet must \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone, is the correct one.\n\nBrown has been called the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in Pluto's demotion, but he says that he has no regrets about his actions. He believes that the controversy over Pluto's status has been blown out of proportion and that it is time to move on.

The study, which was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, used MRI scans to compare the brains of 25 women before and after their first pregnancies, as well as 20 women who did not get pregnant during the study. The results showed that pregnancy caused changes in 11 locations in the brain, including reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter. These changes were mostly still present two years after childbirth, and were not seen in first-time fathers.\n\nThe researchers believe that the changes in the brain are caused by sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. They think that the changes may be a result of the pruning of synapses, which is a process that occurs during adolescence and is thought to produce more specialized and efficient brain circuits.\n\nThe study also found that the brain changes were linked to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant. When women viewed pictures of their babies, several brain regions that reacted the most were ones that showed pregnancy-related change.

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood.

However, the rate of this expansion, known as the Hubble constant, has been a subject of debate among scientists. Recent measurements taken by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the universe is expanding 5 to 9 percent faster than previously predicted. This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of research and debate among scientists, who are trying to understand the underlying physical processes that are driving this expansion.\n\nThe new measurements were made by a team of scientists led by Adam Riess, a Nobel laureate, who used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The team used a new method to calculate the distance to these galaxies, which involved measuring the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The results showed that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5 to 9 percent higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe discrepancy between the new measurements and previous estimates has sparked a range of theories and hypotheses. Some scientists believe that the universe contains unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light. Others believe that dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be shoving galaxies away from each other more powerfully than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery also raises the possibility that Einstein's theory of general relativity, which is the foundation of modern cosmology, may be incomplete or incorrect. This is a significant challenge to the theory, which has been widely accepted for over a century.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and this expansion will eventually lead to the dispersal of all matter across the universe.

The shootings were concentrated on the West and South sides, with the Gresham neighborhood being one of the hardest hit areas. In one incident, eight people were shot, including four teenage girls, in a single shooting. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) has attributed the violence to gang conflicts and has vowed to increase enforcement in the affected areas. CPD Chief of Patrol Fred Waller stated that the department will not be defeated by the violence and will continue to target illegal guns. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has also spoken out about the need to address gun violence, stating that the city needs to work together to reduce crime numbers. The CPD has also announced plans to increase enforcement in the affected areas, including the West Side's Harrison, Ogden, and Austin police districts. The department has confiscated over 5,500 illegal guns this year and is planning coordinated enforcement to target gangs and individuals driving violence. The level of violence has been so severe that local hospitals have been overwhelmed, with Stroger Hospital being forced to limit visitation to immediate family members. The community has come together to offer support and comfort to the families of the victims, with many calling for an end to the violence. Activist Eric Russell has criticized Mayor Emanuel for not doing enough to address gun violence, stating that the city needs to take a more proactive approach to addressing the issue.

The story included a slideshow of all 35 people currently listed as missing in the county.\n\nOne of the missing persons, Rebekah Martinez, was reported missing by her mother in November 2017, but was later found to be alive and well, having appeared on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor.\" Martinez's case highlights the challenges of investigating missing persons cases, particularly when the missing person is an adult who has chosen to cut off contact with their family.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has stated that they take all missing persons reports seriously and follow up on all leads. However, the office also acknowledges that some missing persons cases are more challenging to investigate than others, particularly those involving adults who have chosen to disappear.\n\nThe North Coast Journal's investigation found that many of the missing persons in Humboldt County are adults who have chosen to leave their families and friends behind, often to work in the cannabis industry. The county's remote location and lack of cell phone service can make it difficult for investigators to track down missing persons.\n\nThe investigation also found that some missing persons cases are not actually missing, but rather, the person has chosen to disappear and is not cooperating with investigators. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has stated that they will not remove a person from the missing persons list unless they have been found to be deceased or have been located and cleared.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) is a federal database that connects each case with a caseworker who compares it against reports, looks for patterns, and collaborates with families and local law enforcement.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

The event, called \"Make the Breast Pump Not Suck,\" will bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm new innovations. The hackathon aims to address the current problems with breast pumps, including their loud motors, multiple parts, difficulty in cleaning, and lack of discretion. The event is part of a larger effort to improve maternal and neonatal health, which is an area that \"lags behind others\" in innovation.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about improving breast pumps, but also about making life better for moms, babies, and new families. The event is being organized by a group of MIT Media Lab students and researchers who are also parents, and they are bringing together people from diverse fields, sectors, and backgrounds to take a crack at making life better for families.\n\nSeveral projects have already been developed as a result of the hackathon, including Compress Express, Second Nature, PumpIO, Helping Hands, and Mighty Mom utility belt. These projects aim to improve the design and functionality of breast pumps, making them more discreet, efficient, and user-friendly.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about innovation, but also about raising awareness about the importance of breastfeeding and the challenges that women face in pumping breast milk. The event is being supported by several organizations, including Vecna Technologies, Pejman Mar Ventures, Medela, Naia Health, and Ameda.\n\nThe breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, and it's time for a redesign. The current design of breast pumps is outdated and embarrassing, and it's time for a change.

Snowden, 30, fled Hong Kong on Sunday and arrived in Moscow, where he booked a flight to Cuba. However, he did not show up on the flight, leading to speculation about his whereabouts. \n\nThe U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and revoked his passport, making it difficult for him to travel. The U.S. has also asked Russia to extradite Snowden, but Russia has not confirmed whether it will comply. \n\nSnowden has applied for asylum in Ecuador, and the country's foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, has said that Ecuador is considering his application. Ecuador has a history of defying the U.S. government, and its president, Rafael Correa, has been a vocal critic of U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere. \n\nThe U.S. government has expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Snowden to leave despite a request for his detention. The Hong Kong authorities said that the U.S. request did not fully comply with Hong Kong law, but the U.S. Justice Department rejected this explanation. \n\nSnowden's leaks have caused a stir in China, where the government has been accused of hypocrisy for criticizing the U.S. for its surveillance programs while engaging in similar activities. The Chinese government has said that it is relieved that Snowden is no longer in Hong Kong, but analysts believe that Beijing may have been using Snowden to further its own interests. \n\nThe situation has also raised questions about the role of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, who has been advising Snowden. Assange has said that WikiLeaks helped arrange Snowden's travel documents and that the group is committed to protecting Snowden's rights. \n\nThe U.S. government has expressed concern that Russia or Hong Kong may have had advance notice of Snowden's plans to flee and still allowed him to leave. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said that it would be \"deeply troubling\" if this was the case. \n\nOverall, the situation is complex and has raised questions about the balance between national security and individual rights.

He was also convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers in 2009.\n\nMonis had been consumed by his conviction for sending the offensive letters and had been fighting to have the charges overturned in the High Court. However, he lost his bid to have the matter heard before the High Court on Friday, which may have contributed to his decision to take hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place on Monday.\n\nDuring the 16-hour siege, Monis held 17 hostages, including cafe staff and customers, and demanded to speak to the Prime Minister.

Monis and two hostages, cafe manager Tori Johnson and Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson, were killed in the confrontation.

The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

The coalition, co-founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, consists of mayors from 43 states, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. In 2013, the coalition released a report showing that thousands of individuals with criminal records were seeking to illegally buy guns through online sales. The investigation found that over 25,000 guns could be transferred to individuals with criminal records through the online gun listings on Armslist.com.

The ad demanded that elected officials take immediate action to reduce gun violence. The coalition also released a statement on the failure of the U.S. Senate to pass gun background check legislation. In 2011, the coalition launched a campaign against national concealed carry reciprocity, which would allow individuals to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit. The coalition also released a report showing that states and federal agencies fail to send millions of records to the federal firearms background check system, enabling substance abusers and the mentally ill to buy guns.

The review, which is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI, will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000. Of 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory’s microscopic hair comparison unit, 26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed so far. The cases include those of 32 defendants sentenced to death, 14 of whom have been executed or died in prison.\n\nThe FBI has acknowledged that hair examiners until 2012 lacked written standards defining scientifically appropriate and erroneous ways to explain results in court. The bureau expects this year to complete similar standards for testimony and lab reports for 19 forensic disciplines. The review has also found that examiners made statements exceeding the limits of science in about 90 percent of testimonies, including 34 death-penalty cases.\n\nThe review has been ongoing since 2012, but it was halted last August due to a debate within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards to apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony. The review resumed this month at the order of the Justice Department. The FBI has searched more than 21,000 federal and state requests to its hair comparison unit from 1972 through 1999, identifying for review roughly 2,500 cases where examiners declared hair matches.\n\nThe review has found widespread problems with the FBI’s hair and fiber analysis unit, which has led to the convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people.

While Finding Dory continued its ascension with the biggest domestic third weekend of all time for an animated movie, The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG brought in meager results. The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Roald Dahl's beloved book, earned $18.6 million on its opening weekend, which is a paltry number considering its $140 million budget. The film's fate will rely heavily on the international box office, where it has opened in only two territories so far. If it doesn't work offshore, partners Disney, Amblin Entertainment, and Walden Media are looking at a sizable loss.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance has been a disappointment, and many are wondering what went wrong. Some of the reasons include Spielberg's lack of a surefire hit in recent years, the book's relatively low awareness among modern families, the confusing acronym title, the lack of recognizable faces, and the steep $140 million budget. The film's marketing campaign also failed to convey the emotional bond between the giant and the young orphan girl, which is the film's bread and butter.\n\nThe BFG's performance is a rare misstep for Spielberg, who has a long history of making successful films. However, this is the first time he has directed a film that was intended primarily as a commercial venture. The film's failure implies that the idea of a Steven Spielberg fantasy film is no longer an event, and that such a thing does not have the pull that it once did.\n\nDespite the disappointing box office performance, Spielberg will likely be fine, and Disney will also be okay. The BFG's failure is not a reflection of Spielberg's talent as a filmmaker, but rather a sign of the changing times in the film industry.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio.

The US missiles hit at 3:45 a.m. (0045 GMT) Friday morning and targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower, and ammunition areas. The Syrian military said at least seven people were killed and nine wounded in the missile strike.\n\nThe US strike was widely welcomed by world leaders, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UK, but was condemned by Russia and Iran. Russia's President Vladimir Putin called the strike an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law\" and suspended a memorandum with Washington under which the two countries exchange information about sorties over Syria. The Kremlin also said that just 23 of 59 cruise missiles reached the air base, destroying six Syrian jets but leaving the runway intact.\n\nThe US strike was seen as a significant escalation of the conflict in Syria and raised concerns about the potential for further military action. The US had initially focused on diplomatic efforts after the chemical attack, but had pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution drafted with Britain and France that would have condemned Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons. However, the vote was canceled due to differences among the 15 members.\n\nThe US strike also sparked a debate in Congress about the president's constitutional war powers. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, argued that the president needed congressional authorization for military action, while others, including Sen.

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea. The two women being detained with Suh want to eventually make it to South Korea, but Suh is applying for asylum instead in \"the strongest country on Earth\": the United States.

The study, which was published in the BMJ Open journal, involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved. The researchers found that those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work.\n\nThe study highlights the profound impact that suicide can have on friends and family members, and suggests that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help limit its impact on people's lives. The researchers found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death, and that when the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared.\n\nThe study also suggests that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk. This is because previous studies have shown that family history of suicide is a risk factor for suicide attempt, and the new study found that people who had been bereaved by suicide were more likely to experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these outcomes are not inevitable, and that support is available for those who have been bereaved by suicide. They suggest that simple gestures, such as offering practical help with day-to-day activities, can make a big difference in helping people cope with their loss.\n\nThe study's findings are significant because they highlight the need for greater awareness and understanding of the impact of suicide on friends and family members. It also suggests that addressing social stigma and providing support to those who have been bereaved by suicide can help limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nIn related news, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 800,000 people die by suicide annually, and 60 people are affected by each suicide death. This means that 48 million people are bereaved by suicide worldwide every year.

However, Jabhat al-Nusra's leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has since claimed that his group was not consulted about the merger and has instead pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda's overall leadership.\n\nThe merger has raised concerns among Western powers, who have been providing non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition. The US has designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organization due to its links with Al Qaeda, and the merger is likely to further complicate the situation.

Walker's decision to drop out comes as no surprise to those close to the campaign, who had been bracing for spending cuts, layoffs, and a change in leadership. Walker's departure is now likely to set off a fierce scramble for his big-money backers, led by the Ricketts family, who have emerged as one of the GOP's most powerful financial contributors.

According to this theory, the Democratic bloc is larger and growing at a faster rate than the Republican bloc, making it more likely for Clinton to win.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the Emerging Democratic Majority theory is flawed and that the 2014 midterm elections were a result of districting and turnout issues rather than a shift in public opinion. They also point out that Clinton's personal unpopularity could be a major obstacle in her campaign.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Clinton's campaign has been gaining momentum, with her favorability ratings showing a slight increase. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, Clinton's support is closely divided, with 46% of respondents viewing her favorably and 45% viewing her unfavorably. However, her ratings are still better than those of many of her Republican opponents, including Jeb Bush, who has a 31% favorable rating and a 45% unfavorable rating.\n\nThe economy is also expected to play a major role in the election, with many analysts predicting that a strong economy will help Clinton's chances. President Obama's job approval ratings have also recovered since the midterm elections, with his approval ratings on handling the economy reaching parity with disapproval for the first time since 2009.\n\nHowever, some analysts argue that the economy is not the only factor that will determine the outcome of the election. They point out that voters may be more concerned with the idea of change and may be looking for a candidate who can offer a fresh perspective.

The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, has been negotiating with its creditors, including the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), over a new bailout package. However, the negotiations have stalled, and the Greek government has announced a referendum on whether to accept the creditors' proposals for more austerity measures in exchange for rescue loans.\n\nThe referendum is a high-stakes standoff between the Greek government and its creditors, with the country's future in the eurozone hanging in the balance. The Greek government is asking voters to reject the creditors' proposals, which it claims will lead to further austerity measures and a loss of sovereignty. The creditors, on the other hand, are insisting that the Greek government accept their proposals in order to receive further bailout funds.\n\nThe situation has become increasingly tense, with Greece defaulting on its debts and closing its banks to avoid their collapse. The country has also lost access to billions of euros as an existing bailout deal expired. The Greek government has been trying to persuade voters to reject the creditors' proposals, while the creditors have been trying to persuade voters to accept them.\n\nThe referendum is a complex issue, with many Greeks unsure of what they are voting for. The ballot paper asks voters to accept or reject the creditors' proposals, but the language is complicated and many people are unclear about what it means. The Greek government has been trying to simplify the issue, but the creditors have been trying to make it more complicated.\n\nThe outcome of the referendum is uncertain, with polls showing a dead heat between the \"yes\" and \"no\" camps. However, many Greeks are clear about what they want: they want to stay in the eurozone and avoid further austerity measures. The Greek government is hoping that a \"no\" vote will give it more leverage to negotiate a better deal with the creditors, but the creditors are warning that a \"no\" vote will lead to a tough future for Greece.\n\nThe situation is being closely watched by the international community, with many countries and organizations offering their support to Greece.

Hyde-Smith initially refused to apologize for the remark, but later said she was sorry \"for anyone that was offended.\" \n\nDespite the controversy, Hyde-Smith's campaign was able to depict Espy as too liberal for Mississippi, a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982.

{"pred": " \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, has a complex history with plural marriage. The practice of plural marriage was introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church, in the 1840s. According to the Church, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to practice plural marriage, and he did so, marrying multiple wives and authorizing other Church members to do the same. The practice was seen as a trial of faith for many who participated in it, and it was a source of controversy and opposition.\n\nThe Church believes that monogamy is the Lord's standing law of marriage, but that the Lord also commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage in biblical times. The practice was seen as a way to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant and to \"raise up seed unto the Lord.\" Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes, and it shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not universal among Church members, and not all were expected to live the principle. Women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to marry at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while others initiated the process themselves.\n\nThe U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage in the 1860s, and federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives in the 1880s. The Church continued to practice plural marriage, but in 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued a statement known as the Manifesto, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church.\n\nToday, the Church no longer practices plural marriage, but it does permit a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries. Members are also permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married.\n\nThe introduction of plural marriage in the Church was a difficult and complex process, and it was a source of controversy and opposition. However, for many who participated in it, it was a trial of faith that ultimately brought them closer to God. The practice of plural marriage has shaped the history of the Church and continues to be an important part of its doctrine and practice.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of plural marriage in the Church of Jesus", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The White House said Conway had been \"counseled\" on the matter, but it is unclear what disciplinary action will be taken.\n\nThe controversy began when President Trump tweeted that his daughter had been \"treated so unfairly\" by Nordstrom for dropping her clothing line. Conway then appeared on Fox News and promoted Ivanka's brand, saying it was a \"wonderful line\" and that she would tell viewers to \"go buy it today.\" This move was seen as a direct violation of Office of Government Ethics rules, which prohibit federal employees from using their public office to endorse products.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has been flooded with calls and emails about the incident, and the agency's website crashed due to the high volume of traffic.

A study published in the journal PLOS One found that men who are less skilled at video games are more likely to harass female gamers. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of New South Wales and Miami University, analyzed data from 163 plays of the video game Halo 3 and found that lower-skilled male players made frequent, nasty comments to female gamers. The study suggests that sexist behavior is a response to a threat to a male's position in the hierarchy, and that lower-status males are more likely to be hostile towards female competitors.\n\nAnother study published in the journal PLOS One found that male players who are lower-skilled and performing poorly are more likely to be hostile towards female-voiced teammates in an online first-person shooter video game. The study suggests that this behavior is an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank. The study also found that higher-skilled males are more positive towards female-voiced teammates, suggesting that they are switching to a supportive and potentially mate-attracting role.\n\nThe studies suggest that online harassment and sexism are not just a result of social constructionist theory, but also have an evolutionary component. The studies found that lower-skilled and lower-status males are more likely to be hostile towards female competitors, and that higher-skilled and higher-status males are more supportive. The studies also suggest that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating may be a way to counter sexist behavior.\n\nThe studies have implications for understanding online harassment and sexism, and suggest that video games may be a useful tool for studying these behaviors.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation.

Iranian hackers have been identified as one of the main culprits, with several incidents reported in recent years. In 2013, Iranian hackers infiltrated a small New York dam, and in 2015, they breached the networks of a California power producer, Calpine Corp., stealing sensitive information, including engineering drawings of power plants and user names and passwords. The hackers used this information to gain remote access to the operations networks of the power plants, which could have allowed them to shut down generating stations and cause a blackout.\n\nThe breach at Calpine was not an isolated incident. According to top experts, sophisticated foreign hackers have gained remote access to the operations networks of the U.S. power grid at least a dozen times in the last decade. These attacks have not caused widespread blackouts, but they have raised concerns about the vulnerability of the grid to cyberattacks.\n\nThe U.S. government has acknowledged the threat and has taken steps to strengthen grid cybersecurity. The Department of Homeland Security has issued public warnings to utilities about the risks of cyberattacks and has coordinated efforts to raise awareness about evolving threats to the electric sector. However, experts say that the grid is largely privately owned and has entire sections that fall outside federal regulation, leaving the industry poorly defended against a growing universe of hackers seeking to access its networks.\n\nThe attacks on the power grid are not limited to Iran. Russian hackers have also been linked to several incidents, including a 2012 and 2013 attack on U.S. public utilities and power generators. The Islamic State group has also been trying to hack American power companies, according to a top Homeland Security official.\n\nThe consequences of a cyberattack on the power grid could be devastating. A blackout across 15 states and Washington, D.C. could cost the economy hundreds of billions, raise mortality rates at hospitals, and cut the nation's water supply. Experts say that utilities are unprepared to cope with the threat of such an attack, with much of the technology governing industrial systems being outdated and connected directly to at-risk office networks.\n\nThe U.S. has more than 57,000 industrial-control systems connected to the Internet, and the Department of Homeland Security has issued repeated public warnings to utilities about the risks of cyberattacks.

In fact, per a separate AP investigation, \"sophisticated foreign hackers\" have accessed about a dozen power networks here, attacks that the AP says the US public is rarely informed about. US infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe.

The results showed that while the number of high school seniors who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days has largely plateaued, the rate of teenagers using nicotine – either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes – is on the rise. In 2014, about 14 percent of Southern California high school seniors said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days.\n\nThe study found that e-cigarettes do not appear to have made a dent in regular cigarette use, and instead have enticed an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine. The researchers say that the numbers suggest that rather than prompting teenagers to replace cigarette smoking with vaping, e-cigarettes instead have enticed an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine.\n\nThe study also found that the amount of nicotine in the liquids used with e-cigarettes varies, and users can purchase liquid with no nicotine or nicotine content ranging from 3 milligrams per milliliter to 18 milligrams per milliliter or even higher. While earlier studies have suggested that some teens are using nicotine-free vaping liquids, researchers say the majority of teens appear to be using nicotine-infused liquid in their e-cigarettes.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with national trends, and researchers say that the e-cigarette industry is not regulated, which makes it hard to know what ingredients are actually in any given product. The Food and Drug Administration recently took jurisdiction over e-cigarettes, but it will be years before any regulations are put into effect.\n\nAnother study published in Pediatrics found that the prevalence of combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was 13.7%, which is substantially greater than the 9.0% adjusted prevalence of current cigarette use in 2004, before e-cigarettes were available.

The NIC has argued that such policies are unfair and infringe on students' freedom of association. However, some higher education leaders have argued that delaying recruitment can save lives, as freshmen are more vulnerable to binge drinking and other risks associated with fraternity life.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, 24 fraternity-related deaths have occurred since 2005, with 40% of those deaths being of freshmen. The NIC has opposed proposals at dozens of colleges to delay recruiting by a semester or a year, and has instead advocated for increased oversight and education on alcohol safety.\n\nThe NIC has also been accused of using its influence to pressure universities into lifting restrictions on fraternity recruitment. For example, the University of Central Florida lifted a recruitment moratorium after the NIC threatened to sue the school for violating students' freedom-of-association rights.\n\nFraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, critics argue that these measures are insufficient and that the NIC is more concerned with protecting its own interests than with ensuring the safety of students.\n\nThe financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, with parents often having to pay for their children's legal defense and damages in the event of a lawsuit. The NIC has a crisis-management plan in place to deal with such situations, which includes advising fraternity members to be honest and forthcoming in their accounts of what happened.\n\nThe plan has been criticized for prioritizing the interests of the national organization over those of individual members, and for potentially putting members at risk of being dropped from the fraternity's insurance or being blamed for their actions.\n\nThe debate over fraternity safety and the role of the NIC has sparked a wider conversation about the risks and benefits of fraternity membership. While some argue that fraternities can provide valuable opportunities for leadership, service, and personal growth, others argue that the risks associated with fraternity life outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nUltimately, the decision to join a fraternity should be made by individual students and their families, taking into account the potential risks and benefits.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

It has a unique appearance, with a wingspan of up to 1.9 feet and squat, pointed ears. The bat's lips are pointed upwards, creating a funnel-shaped mouth. It prefers to roost in caves and tunnels and occasionally roosts with other bat species. The mustached bat appears on the IUCN Red List with a conservation status of \"Least Concern\".\n\nResearch has been conducted on the mustached bat's auditory cortex, which is specialized for processing complex sounds. The bat's brain is capable of processing both temporal and spectral information, which is essential for its survival. The mustached bat uses echolocation to navigate and hunt, emitting sounds that are comprised of a constant frequency (CF) and downward frequency modulation (FM). The bat's auditory cortex is organized in a way that allows it to process these complex sounds, with different areas of the brain responsible for processing different aspects of the sound.\n\nA study published in Frontiers of Neuroscience found that mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds, similar to humans. The left brain is better at processing fast sounds, while the right brain is better at processing slow sounds. This asymmetrical sound processing is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. The study suggests that this asymmetry may be related to the bat's social behavior and its need to use sonar to track the velocity of fast-moving insects.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for understanding human language disorders and potentially improving computer speech recognition.

However, the nomination was counterproductive as it revealed that the Nobel Foundation rules forbid public disclosure of nominations for 50 years. \n\nCraig Steven Wright, an Australian computer expert and entrepreneur, has been identified as a possible creator of Bitcoin.

In a 2014 meeting, Wright was quoted as saying, \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.\" \n\nWright's identity was first revealed by Wired magazine, which cited old blog posts and leaked documents.

The raid was for a tax investigation, and a spokesman said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. \n\nThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a mystery since the currency's computer code was released in 2009, with several false leads having been aired and debunked. The growing value of Bitcoin has driven the search for its creator or creators. \n\nWright's involvement in Bitcoin has been linked to his company, Tulip Trading, which built two supercomputers that have officially ranked among the top 500 in the world. Wright has also been linked to a trust fund, the \"Tulip Trust,\" which contains 1.1 million bitcoins. The trust fund is locked until 2020, but Wright has the freedom to borrow the coins for research or commercial activities. \n\nWright's revelation of his possible involvement in Bitcoin has sparked a range of reactions, from excitement to skepticism.

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison, though many of the details remain classified. \n\nThe White House has welcomed a debate over the electronic surveillance programs, but President Barack Obama has said that the measures are a necessary middle way between total privacy and unacceptable threat. Obama has also said that the programs are judged by the president and his national security team to be necessary and effective, and that they are also accorded oversight by all three branches of government. \n\nSnowden's actions have been met with both praise and criticism. Some have hailed him as a hero, while others have called him a defector and a traitor. Senator Bill Nelson has called Snowden's actions \"an act of treason,\" while Senator Dianne Feinstein has questioned whether his access to government secrets was as extensive as he claims. \n\nSnowden's choice of Hong Kong as a haven from where to leak intelligence documents and to unmask himself as a whistleblower rests on calculations on the territory's press freedom safeguards and its extradition treaty with the US. However, Beijing, which gave its consent for Hong Kong to sign the agreement, also has a right of veto if it believes the surrender of a fugitive would harm the \"defence, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China. \n\nSnowden's extradition might be seen in the party leadership in Beijing as a capitulation, but such calculations can change. The US and China have an often testy relationship, and the party leadership in Beijing may not want to give the US a victory in this case. \n\nIn related news, the US has signed a new extradition treaty with Hong Kong, which makes Snowden's fate a matter of political expediency not just in Hong Kong but in Beijing.

However, the water from the Flint River was not properly treated, and it contained high levels of lead and other contaminants. This led to widespread health problems, including lead poisoning, Legionnaires' disease, and other waterborne illnesses.\n\nIn 2015, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the city of Flint were aware of the problems with the water, but they failed to take action to address them. In fact, they even altered reports to conceal the true extent of the contamination. This was a deliberate attempt to cover up the crisis and avoid taking responsibility for it.\n\nIn 2016, Attorney General Bill Schuette launched an investigation into the crisis, and he filed charges against several state employees who were involved in the cover-up. The charges included misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. The employees who were charged included Nancy Peeler, Robert Scott, Corinne Miller, Adam Rosenthal, Patrick Cook, and Liane Shekter Smith.\n\nThe investigation found that the employees had altered reports, deleted emails, and ignored warnings from experts about the contamination. They had also misled the public and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about the safety of the water. The investigation also found that the city of Flint had failed to properly treat the water, and that the MDEQ had failed to enforce the law and protect the public's health.\n\nIn addition to the charges against the state employees, the city of Flint has also faced numerous lawsuits related to the crisis. The lawsuits have been filed by residents who were affected by the contamination, as well as by organizations that are seeking to hold the city and the state accountable for their actions.\n\nThe crisis has had a significant impact on the residents of Flint, including children who have been poisoned by the lead in the water. The city has been working to replace the lead pipes and to provide safe drinking water to its residents. However, the crisis is far from over, and many residents are still struggling to access safe drinking water.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several developments in the crisis. In 2017, the city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply, and the governor declared a state of emergency.

According to testimony in Flint district court Friday morning, three workers in the state's health department—Nancy Peeler, Robert Scott, Corinne Miller—and three in the environmental office—water regulators Patrick Cook and Adam Rosenthal and ex-municipal water chief Liane Shekter-Smith—were hit with charges filed by AG Bill Schuette, per the Detroit Free Press. MLive.com reports that all six were charged with misconduct in office, with willful neglect of duty and various conspiracy charges also being assigned. Schuette filed criminal charges in April against two other state employees and a city water utility official. In the Department of Health and Human Services, alleged transgressions include reliance on shoddy data and hiding or ignoring bloodstream test results that indicated the significant presence of lead. Within the Department of Environmental Quality, accusations include workers manipulating water monitoring reports, purposely \"misinterpreting\" federal drinking-water standards, and trying to mislead the EPA, as well as suggesting ways to keep an EPA expert quiet about concerns. Shekter-Smith, meanwhile, is said to have turned a blind eye as evidence of water contamination became clearer. Meanwhile, per the Wall Street Journal, federal experts say filtered Flint tap water is safe to drink, but Mayor Karen Weaver noted Wednesday at the Democratic convention that the city's crisis is far from over. \"Our infrastructure is broken, leaking, and rusting away,\" she said, per CNN."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8503}

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

The technology, which uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), allows patients to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions by detecting patterns in their brain activity. Four patients, aged 24 to 76, were trained to use the system and were able to answer questions about their quality of life, with all four indicating that they were \"happy\" with life. The study, led by neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer, suggests that CLIS patients may not be as miserable as previously thought and that they may even experience a positive quality of life. The technology has the potential to transform the lives of people with CLIS, who are unable to communicate with the world due to their condition. The study's findings were published in the journal Plos Biology.\n\nThe technology works by using a cap that detects variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain. As the patient answers questions, a computer learns to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient. The system was able to achieve a classification accuracy of over 70% in the training sessions, and the patients were able to answer questions about their quality of life, including whether they were \"happy\" with life.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the treatment and care of CLIS patients.

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

The 10 percent Pentagon boost is financed by $54 billion in cuts to foreign aid and domestic agencies that had been protected by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe budget proposal also includes cuts to various government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which would lose over 3,000 jobs and see programs such as Obama's Clean Power Plan eliminated.

Scalia was a guest at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a resort in the Big Bend region south of Marfa, Texas. He had arrived at the ranch on Friday and attended a private party with about 40 people. He left the party and retired to bed earlier than others. When he failed to appear at breakfast, a person involved with the ranch went to his room, where he discovered his body. A priest was called to administer last rites.\n\nAccording to a federal official, there was no evidence of foul play and it appeared that Scalia died of natural causes. The U.S. Marshals Service, the Presidio County sheriff, and the FBI were involved in the investigation. Officials with the law enforcement agencies declined to comment.\n\nScalia's death has far-reaching implications for the Supreme Court and a round of major cases the justices are set to decide this summer. President Barack Obama is unlikely to successfully name a new justice to replace Scalia before his second presidential term ends, as Congress will block any appointment he tries to make.\n\nScalia's death immediately became an issue in the presidential race, with five of the six candidates taking part in a GOP debate Saturday night urging Republicans to block any attempt by the president to get his third nominee on the court. Only Jeb Bush said Obama had \"every right\" to nominate a justice during his final year in office.\n\nPresident Obama praised Scalia as a brilliant legal mind who influenced a generation of lawyers and students. He also announced his intentions to nominate a successor, saying he plans to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to fill the vacancy. Scalia was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nScalia's death has sparked a debate about whether President Obama should fill the seat in an election year. Obama said Saturday night that he plans to nominate a replacement, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the nomination should wait until the next president comes into office. Top Democrat Harry Reid called for the seat to be filled \"right away.\"\n\nScalia's legacy is enormous. He was the Court's leading originalist, fiercely dedicated to the idea that the meaning of the words in the Constitution are fixed based on the framers' understanding at the time they were drafted, and not subject to reinterpretation in later times.

The mission aims to investigate the origins of solar wind, including the mysterious heating of the sun’s atmosphere and how the solar wind accelerates to astonishing speeds of up to 400 miles per second. The spacecraft will travel far closer to the sun than any previous probe, coming within 4 million miles of its surface, and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission is expected to provide unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun, including the acceleration of solar wind and the heating of the sun’s corona. The findings will help scientists to better understand the sun and its impact on the solar system, and will also improve space weather forecasting, which is crucial for protecting satellites and astronauts from the effects of solar storms. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete. The spacecraft will make 24 close flybys of the sun, and will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The mission is a testament to the importance of Parker’s work, which has revolutionized our understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. Parker was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in honor of his lifetime’s work, and a chip with pictures of him and his seminal paper on solar wind will be included on the spacecraft. The mission will also carry a plate with an inscription of Parker’s choice, which will be installed on the spacecraft. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to change our understanding of the sun and the solar system, and will provide valuable insights into the physics of stars.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The researchers found that global sea levels stayed fairly steady for about 3,000 years, but then began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, with the seas rising 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000.

The shooting was the deadliest school shooting since the Parkland, Florida, attack in February.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Pagourtzis entered an art classroom and began shooting, killing several students and teachers. One student, Zachary Muehe, described the scene as \"crazy\" and said he saw students lying on the ground. Muehe and his friends escaped through a ceramics closet and ran to the other side of the campus.\n\nThe authorities released few details of their encounter with Pagourtzis, but Col. Steven C.

The plan would eliminate premiums for private health insurance, deductibles, and co-pays, and would be funded through a combination of taxes, including a proposed new 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and tax hikes on the wealthy. The bill has gained significant support from Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have all cosponsored the bill. The plan has also been endorsed by several progressive groups, including the National Nurses United.\n\nThe bill would phase out the current system over a four-year transition period, with Medicare being expanded to cover dental, vision, and hearing aid coverage in the first year, and the eligibility age being reduced to 55. Children up to age 18 would be offered immediate access to the government-run plan, and the Medicare age would be reduced to 45, then 35 years old, by the end of the transition period.\n\nDespite the significant legislative obstacles in its way, single-payer as a concept is gaining traction among the public, with 53% of Americans supporting a national health care plan, according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The bill's introduction has been seen as a significant moment for the progressive grassroots movement that fueled Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHowever, the bill's financing and implementation have been criticized, with some arguing that it would be too expensive and would require significant tax increases.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance.

However, the Pennsylvania judge set a high bar for liability, requiring that the third party knew or should have known that the driver was texting and would view the text while on the road.\n\nIn New York, lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow police officers to use a device called a textalyzer to determine whether a driver was using their phone at the time of an accident.

The driver, who was 18 years old at the time of the accident, had been using Snapchat’s speedometer feature and was driving at 107 mph when she crashed into another car.\n\nExperts say that these developments could signal a shift in how society views distracted driving. Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, notes that distracted driving is often seen as a socially acceptable sin, but that these legal developments could help change that perception.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether phone companies and app developers will be held accountable for accidents caused by their products.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases.

{"pred": " \nThe news reports on the astronomical gap between the pay of workers and bosses in America. According to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, the chief executives of America’s top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year. The pay gap has risen dramatically since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. In 1965, the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one, but it peaked in 2000 at 344 to one. The pay gap has been rising rapidly since 2009, with CEOs earning 5.5 times as much as the average earner in the top 0.1%. The report highlights the extreme pay-ratio problem, with some CEOs earning hundreds of times more than their workers. For example, McDonald’s boss Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7m while the McDonald’s workers earned a median wage of just $7,017 – a CEO to worker pay ratio of 3,101 to one.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap is not just a result of rising stock markets, but rather a result of the way CEOs are compensated. The compensation bonanza was driven by stock-related components of CEO compensation, such as stock awards or the opportunity to cash in stock options. Between 1978 and 2017, CEO compensation has increased by 979%, while the S&P 500 Index grew 637% and the typical workers’ pay package rose just 11.2%.\n\nThe report suggests that the pay gap has had a direct impact on people down the corporate ladder, with the redistribution of wages to the top 5% affecting the wage growth of the bottom 90%. The authors argue that the pay gap is a result of a loosening of norms, with CEOs being paid more and more as a result of rent-seeking behavior.\n\nThe news also highlights the use of stock-related components of CEO compensation, which has led to a significant increase in CEO pay. The report notes that the value of stock awards and the fair value of stock awards are similar, and that the levels and changes in the two variables are similar. The authors use this information to estimate the fair value of stock awards in 2017, which is used to calculate the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap is not just a result of the way CEOs are compensated, but also a result of the way companies are governed.

The story of Scott Stevens, a 52-year-old man who lost his job, his family, and ultimately his life to his addiction, is used as a case study. Stevens, a former chief operating officer at Louis Berkman Investment, had a successful career and a loving family, but he became hooked on slot machines after a trip to Las Vegas in 2006. He lost millions of dollars, drained his family's savings, and eventually took his own life.\n\nThe article suggests that the casino industry is designed to prey on people's weaknesses and that slot machines are specifically engineered to be addictive. The machines use complex algorithms and virtual reel mapping to create the illusion of near misses and to make players believe they are winning when they are not. This can lead to a phenomenon known as \"losses disguised as wins,\" where players are given the impression of winning when they are actually losing.\n\nThe article also discusses the role of casino hosts and the way they target problem gamblers and addicts. These hosts use data collected from players to identify those who are most likely to spend large amounts of money and offer them perks and VIP treatment to keep them coming back.\n\nThe article cites several examples of people who have been exploited by casinos, including Caroline Richardson, a woman who lost nearly $2 million at the Ameristar Casino in Iowa and was given VIP treatment by the casino.

It suggests that the industry's business plan is based on the addicted gambler, rather than the occasional gambler, and that casinos use a variety of tactics to keep players coming back, including near misses, losses disguised as wins, and VIP treatment.\n\nThe article also mentions that several countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have outlawed virtual reel mapping due to its harm to players, but the US has not taken similar action.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

{"pred": " \nA recent study has found that older fathers tend to have children who are more intelligent, focused, and socially aloof, often referred to as \"geeks.\" The study, which analyzed data from over 30,000 twins, found that the older the father, the higher the child's \"geek index\" score. The geek index score is a measure of a child's non-verbal IQ, focus on subjects of interest, and social aloofness. The study found that children born to older fathers tend to perform better in school, particularly in STEM subjects, and are more likely to achieve higher grades.\n\nThe study's lead author, Magdalena Janecka, suggests that the link between older fathers and geekier children may be due to the fact that older fathers are more likely to have higher levels of \"geekiness\" themselves. Men who delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and are more likely to display higher levels of \"geekiness.\" This suggests that the geek effect may be heritable, with some genetic traits being passed down from fathers to sons.\n\nHowever, the study also found that the link between older fathers and geekier children may be due to other factors, such as the fact that older men are more likely to have stable, better-paid jobs that provide a home setting that encourages geeky traits. The study's authors also suggest that new mutations in sperm that affect development may also play a role.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with both excitement and caution. While some scientists are enthusiastic about the prospect of a \"society of geniuses\" that can solve the world's problems, others are warning that the dangers of older parenting, such as an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage, or conceiving a child with a variety of debilitating disorders, should not be ignored.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the link between older fathers and geekier children may be due to differences in the way the brains of boys and girls develop. They suggest that the measure of geekiness may have failed to spot differences in how it emerges in boys and girls, or that it may be down to differences in the way the brains of the two sexes develop.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that older fathers may have a positive impact on their children's cognitive and social development, but that the link between older fathers and geekier children is complex and multifaceted.

And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
