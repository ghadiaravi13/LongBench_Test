He has raised over £33,500 for the charity.\n\nSears' family and friends have been congratulating him on his achievement.

He was a key supporter of Booker T. Washington and the Tuskegee Institute, and he provided funding for the construction of over 5,000 schools for African-American children in the rural South.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.

According to Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 16.6% of executive officers, and 17.9% of board directors. This disparity is costing companies talent and hurting the country's competitiveness.\n\nTo address this issue, companies and schools need to take proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. This can be achieved by introducing girls to female role models, supporting programs that groom female talent, and providing sponsorship opportunities. Companies can also use Take Our Children to Work Day to highlight the achievements of women in leadership positions and provide girls with a tangible example of what leadership looks like.\n\nThe Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to see more women in leadership positions, and 60% of girls believe that women are not good leaders.

The CIA has disputed some of the report's findings, and the agency has been accused of monitoring the computers of Senate staff members who worked on the report. The CIA has also been accused of withholding documents from the Senate committee, which has led to a breakdown in relations between the two. The dispute has become so heated that the CIA's Inspector General has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency. The White House has been closely following the dispute, but has not directly intervened. The report's release has been delayed for nearly 15 months, and it is unclear whether it will ever be made public.

{"pred": " \nAntarctic notothenioid fish have developed antifreeze proteins to protect themselves from freezing in the cold waters of Antarctica. However, these proteins have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent the fish from freezing but also prevent them from melting the ice that forms inside their bodies. This means that the fish are left with a lifelong accumulation of ice in their bodies, which could potentially be harmful. Researchers have discovered that the antifreeze proteins in these fish prevent the ice from melting even when the fish are exposed to warmer temperatures, a phenomenon known as \"superheating.\" This has led to a new understanding of the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the potential costs of this adaptation.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fish prevent the ice from melting even when the fish are exposed to temperatures above 32°F (0°C), which is the melting point of ice. This means that the fish are left with a lifelong accumulation of ice in their bodies, which could potentially be harmful.\n\nThe researchers also found that the antifreeze proteins in these fish are not just a simple adaptation to the cold temperatures, but rather a complex mechanism that has evolved over time.

Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

{"pred": " \nThe Pacific coast of North America is facing a severe decline in the population of Pacific sardines, a crucial forage fish that supports dozens of species of seabirds, whales, sharks, and commercially important fish such as salmon. The decline has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle, overfishing, and the shift of ocean conditions that make it less favorable for sardines to thrive. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has implemented measures to reduce the catch of sardines, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing to allow the population to recover. The decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect on the ecosystem, with many species of seabirds, sea lions, and other predators struggling to find food. In fact, a recent study found that 1,600 sea lion pups were malnourished in 2013, likely due to the scarcity of sardines. The Pacific sardine population has fluctuated wildly over the years, with a previous collapse in the 1950s and a rebound in the 1990s. However, the current decline is the steepest in generations, and scientists are warning that if the population does not recover soon, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years to come. The value of sardines as a food source for other species is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, and their loss could have significant economic and ecological impacts. As a result, conservation efforts are underway to protect the sardine population and restore the health of the West Coast's marine ecosystem. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone, without any emotional language or sensationalism.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The study suggests that the main reasons for lapsing include transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other vegetarians or vegans, and not being able to address food cravings. The study also found that current vegetarians or vegans have a wide range of motivations for their diet, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.\n\nA personal account by a former vegetarian highlights the challenges of maintaining a vegetarian diet, particularly when social pressures and cravings for meat are involved. The author describes how he transitioned to a vegetarian diet in his early 20s but eventually lapsed after 15 years, citing the difficulty of sticking to a \"pure\" diet and the pressure to conform to societal norms.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that a more effective approach to promoting vegetarianism and veganism may be to focus on reducing meat consumption rather than demanding complete elimination of animal products.

Others, like Baseball Joe, are disappointed to see the intentional walk disappear because it was a fun moment to watch. \n\nHowever, the change may not have a significant impact on the game's pace.

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The Clarion Nightsnake was first spotted by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 on the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast. However, subsequent visits failed to find more of the snakes, and it was assumed that the original specimen was a labelling error. The snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries, but Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, set out to find the snake, using Beebe's original field notes as a guide. They timed their expedition to replicate Beebe's steps and used DNA analysis to establish the snake as its own species. The tests showed that the snake is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sonora coast, more than 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk. The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The snake is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts.

The study, which involved 891 women, found that those who had additional lymph nodes removed after a biopsy had no better survival rates than those who did not have the procedure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, led by Dr. Armando Giuliano, found that for women who had chemotherapy and radiation, removing additional lymph nodes did not improve their chances of survival. In fact, the procedure can cause complications such as infection and lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the arm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study's findings are significant because they challenge the long-held assumption that removing cancerous lymph nodes is necessary to improve survival rates. For decades, surgeons have removed lymph nodes from the armpit as a routine part of breast cancer treatment, believing that it would help prevent the cancer from spreading.

That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior.

According to a study published in the journal Nature, the continent is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with about 3 trillion tons of ice disappearing since 1992. This is equivalent to a 150-meter-thick layer of ice covering the entire continent. The study, which was conducted by an international team of scientists, used satellite data and computer simulations to track the changes in Antarctica's ice sheet.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice sheet is losing about 150 billion tons of ice per year, which is a significant increase from the previous rate of 75 billion tons per year. This means that the ice sheet is now losing about 40% more ice than it was 25 years ago.\n\nThe study also found that the ice sheet is losing ice at a faster rate in the western part of the continent, where the ice is thinner and more vulnerable to melting. The researchers attribute this to the warming of the ocean waters surrounding Antarctica, which is causing the ice to melt from beneath.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, warned that the melting of Antarctica's ice sheet could have significant consequences for global sea levels. He estimated that if the ice sheet were to melt completely, it could raise global sea levels by up to 58 meters.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Nature found that the melting of Antarctica's ice sheet is not just a local problem, but a global one. The study found that the melting of the ice sheet is contributing to sea level rise around the world, and that the effects of this melting will be felt for centuries to come.\n\nThe news has sparked concerns about the impact of climate change on the planet.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn't get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. (Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy). No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers, reports the AP. What's going on? Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In 11 places in the brain, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter, but it's not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women, perhaps to prepare a woman for motherhood. One analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant."], "all_classes": null, "length": 5651}

According to recent measurements taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the universe is expanding at a rate of 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec. This is 5-10% higher than the previously estimated rate. The discrepancy between the new measurements and the previous estimates has sparked a debate among scientists about the nature of the universe and the forces that are driving its expansion.\n\nThe new measurements were made possible by the Hubble Space Telescope's ability to measure the distances between galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. By analyzing the light emitted by galaxies, scientists were able to determine the rate at which the universe is expanding.\n\nThe implications of the new measurements are far-reaching. If the universe is indeed expanding at a faster rate than previously thought, it could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe's age, size, and ultimate fate. It could also challenge our current understanding of the universe's fundamental laws, such as gravity and dark energy.\n\nThe new measurements have also sparked a debate about the nature of dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be driving the universe's expansion.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

The victims ranged in age from 14 to 43 years old, and many were shot in drive-by shootings or while standing on the street.\n\nAccording to police, the shootings were concentrated in several neighborhoods, including West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, and Englewood. The victims included men, women, and children, and many were shot multiple times.\n\nThe violence was so severe that it overwhelmed the city's hospitals, with many emergency rooms forced to divert patients to other facilities.

The event, which will take place on September 20-21, aims to bring together engineers, designers, and mothers to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions to the problems associated with breast pumps. The hackathon is a response to the fact that breast pumps are often poorly designed, making it difficult for mothers to express milk comfortably and discreetly.\n\nAccording to a survey, 77% of mothers use breast pumps, but many of them find the experience to be painful, awkward, and embarrassing. The breast pump is often seen as a necessary evil, but it can be a source of stress and anxiety for many mothers. The hackathon aims to change this by bringing together experts and mothers to design a better breast pump.\n\nThe hackathon will feature a range of projects, including the development of a more comfortable and discreet breast pump, a breast pump that can be controlled by a smartphone app, and a breast pump that can be used in public without drawing attention. The event will also feature a range of speakers and workshops, including a talk by a lactation consultant and a workshop on how to design a breast pump that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe hackathon is being organized by a team of students and faculty at MIT, who are passionate about improving the design of breast pumps. They believe that a better breast pump can make a big difference in the lives of mothers and babies, and they are excited to see the innovative solutions that will be developed during the event.\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, there are several other initiatives underway to improve the design of breast pumps. For example, a group of designers and engineers are working on a new breast pump that is designed to be more comfortable and discreet. The pump uses a soft, flexible material that is gentle on the skin and can be worn under clothing. The pump also features a built-in battery that can be charged via USB, making it easy to use on the go.\n\nAnother initiative is the \"Make the Breast Pump Not Suck\" challenge, which is being run by a group of entrepreneurs who are passionate about improving the design of breast pumps. The challenge is asking designers and engineers to submit their ideas for a better breast pump, and the winner will receive a cash prize and the opportunity to turn their idea into a reality.\n\nOverall, the \"Make the Breast Pump Not Suck\" hackathon and the other initiatives underway to improve the design of breast pumps are a response", "answers": ["It might not be the first thing that comes to mind after the word \"hackathon,\" but organizers of an upcoming one at MIT say the world is long overdue for a better breast pump.

Maury Rubin, the owner of City Bakery, created the pretzel croissant, which was inspired by his training in France. Rubin believes that innovation in baking is driven by the desire to create something new and exciting, and that the pretzel croissant is a perfect example of this. However, Rubin is critical of the Cronut, created by Dominique Ansel, which he believes is a mass-produced, commercialized version of the pretzel croissant.\n\nThe Cronut, which consists of a croissant dough wrapped around a doughnut, was introduced by Ansel in 2013 and quickly became a viral sensation. Ansel's bakery was flooded with customers, and the Cronut became a symbol of the city's culinary scene. However, Ansel has resisted the commercialization of the Cronut, and has limited its production to prevent it from becoming too mainstream.\n\nDunkin' Donuts has recently introduced its own version of the croissant-doughnut hybrid, called the Croissant Donut, which will be available for a limited time starting November 3.

The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

It sure sounded like a candidate's speech, writes Sean Sullivan in the Washington Post, who says Clinton must \"get in the game\" on key issues if she does indeed plan to run. On this issue in particular, Clinton can \"make her case as the heir apparent to Obama and try to persuade parts of his coalition—minorities and liberals in particular—to back her.\" (She spoke on the same day that North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed into place a law requiring voters to have a photo ID, reports the News & Observer.)

The movie, which was expected to be a commercial success, earned only $18.5 million in its opening weekend, making it the lowest opening weekend for a Spielberg film in over 20 years. The film's poor performance has raised questions about Spielberg's ability to connect with modern audiences and his reliance on nostalgia.\n\nThe BFG's box office flop has been attributed to several factors, including the film's confusing marketing campaign, the lack of a clear target audience, and the competition from other summer blockbusters. Additionally, the film's $250 million budget and the high expectations surrounding it may have contributed to its disappointing performance.\n\nDespite the film's poor box office results, Spielberg remains one of the most successful filmmakers in the industry, with a long history of creating critically acclaimed and commercially successful films. However, the failure of The BFG may indicate a shift in the types of films that audiences are interested in, with a greater emphasis on adult-oriented dramas and a decline in interest in traditional summer blockbusters.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance has also been compared to other recent films that have failed to connect with audiences, including The Purge: Election Year and The Legend of Tarzan. However, unlike these films, The BFG has received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its visual effects and performances.\n\nThe failure of The BFG has also sparked a debate about the role of nostalgia in filmmaking, with some arguing that Spielberg's reliance on nostalgia has contributed to the film's poor performance. Others have suggested that the film's failure may be a sign that audiences are looking for more complex and mature storytelling, rather than the traditional summer blockbuster fare that Spielberg has become known for.\n\nOverall, the box office performance of The BFG has been a disappointment for Spielberg and Disney, but it remains to be seen whether the film will be a long-term success or a one-time failure.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed—she didn't respond to the story—but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.'

The practice was introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, in the 1840s. Smith received a revelation from God that commanded him to practice plural marriage, and he began to marry multiple women, including some who were already married. The practice was initially kept secret, but it eventually became public knowledge and was met with widespread criticism and persecution.\n\nThe church's leaders, including Brigham Young, continued to practice plural marriage after Smith's death, and it became a central part of the church's culture in Utah. However, the practice was also a source of controversy and conflict, both within the church and with the outside world. In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which made it a federal crime to practice polygamy. The church's leaders continued to defy the law, and the practice of plural marriage became a major point of contention between the church and the U.S. government.\n\nIn 1890, the church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a manifesto, known as the \"Manifesto,\" which officially ended the practice of plural marriage. The manifesto was a response to the growing pressure from the U.S. government and the public to end the practice. However, the church's leaders continued to perform secret plural marriages, and it wasn't until 1904 that the church officially disavowed the practice.\n\nToday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not practice plural marriage, and it is considered a sin by the church.

However, the legacy of plural marriage continues to be a complex and sensitive topic within the church, and it remains a source of controversy and debate.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage had a significant impact on the lives of many women and children within the church. Many women were forced to enter into plural marriages against their will, and they often suffered physical and emotional abuse. Children born into plural marriages often faced stigma and discrimination, and they were often forced to live in poverty.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\").

He added that \"they no longer cover news.\" As the Hill reports, Drudge has responded by linking to a January story in which Cruz sounded pleased with the site: \"We have got the Internet, we have got the Drudge Report,\" he said at the time. Drudge also linked to an analysis in the Washington Post headlined, \"Ted Cruz’s war with Matt Drudge could become a huge problem for his campaign.\" In that piece, James Hohmann writes that a \"word cloud\" from social media shows that Drudge is making an impact, with the words \"cheating\" and \"drudge\" showing up among mentions of Cruz's Colorado win. This should worry Cruz because it could make his victories seem illegitimate to conservatives. \"If Cruz wins the nomination at a contested convention in Cleveland, he will need these grass-roots activists to rally around him,\" writes Hohmann. \"If regular Drudge readers believe he did not win fair and square, they will be less inclined to do so.\" A blogger at the American Spectator, meanwhile, dismisses the \"reprehensible\" coverage on Drudge as \"cheap tabloid tricks.\" Trump is looking for a \"distraction\" from the reality that he was beaten soundly in Colorado, where the rules were clear, writes Ross Kaminsky."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7121}

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

The species is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. The mustached bat is a carnivorous species, feeding on insects and small vertebrates. The species is listed as \"least concern\" on the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is not considered to be threatened with extinction.\n\nIn a recent study, researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center and American University found that mustached bats use both sides of their brains to process sound, similar to humans. This is a unique characteristic among animals, and the researchers believe that it may be related to the bats' ability to navigate and communicate in their environment. The study found that the bats' brains are asymmetrical, with the left hemisphere being more specialized for processing sound than the right hemisphere. This is similar to the human brain, where the left hemisphere is specialized for language processing.\n\nThe researchers believe that this unique characteristic of the mustached bat's brain may be related to its ability to navigate and communicate in its environment.

However, the Nobel Committee has rules that prevent anonymous individuals from receiving the prize, so Nakamoto is not eligible.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of investigations by WIRED magazine and other outlets have pointed to Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, as the possible creator of Bitcoin.

In one email, Wright wrote that he had been working on a cryptocurrency project since 2007, and in another, he mentioned that he had been trying to keep his involvement in Bitcoin a secret.\n\nWright has denied being Satoshi Nakamoto, but the evidence suggests otherwise. A raid on his home in Sydney was conducted by Australian tax authorities, who were investigating Wright for tax evasion. The raid was reportedly unrelated to the Bitcoin investigation, but it has raised suspicions that Wright may be involved in the creation of the digital currency.\n\nThe investigation into Wright's involvement in Bitcoin has been ongoing for several months, and it has been fueled by a series of leaks and tips from anonymous sources. One of the most significant leaks came from a former colleague of Wright's, who claimed that Wright had been working on a cryptocurrency project in the early 2000s.\n\nThe investigation has also been fueled by a series of blog posts and articles written by Wright, which suggest that he has a deep understanding of cryptography and computer science.

As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart.

The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

The technology, developed by a team of researchers at the University of Tübingen, uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect changes in blood flow in the brain, which are then translated into words or phrases. The device has been tested on four patients with CLIS, who were able to answer questions and even express their opinions on personal matters.\n\nThe patients, who were all fed through tubes and cared for at home, were able to communicate with their families and caregivers through the device, which was controlled by a computer program. The researchers found that the patients were able to answer questions with a high degree of accuracy, and even expressed their opinions on personal matters, such as whether they were happy with their lives.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, found that all four patients reported being happy with their lives, despite being physically locked-in and unable to express themselves. This challenges the common assumption that patients with CLIS are unhappy and unfulfilled.\n\nThe technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate with patients with CLIS, and could also be used to improve the quality of life for these patients. The researchers are now working on developing the technology further, with the goal of creating a more portable and user-friendly device.\n\nThe study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, said that the technology has the potential to \"abolish\" CLIS, and that the results of the study are \"satisfying\" and \"encouraging\".

Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

However, Lance's theory has been met with skepticism by other researchers, who argue that the evidence is not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm her findings.\n\nLance's theory is based on a series of experiments she conducted using a scale model of the Hunley. In the experiments, Lance simulated the conditions that the crew would have faced during the sinking of the USS Housatonic, including the buildup of carbon dioxide and the lack of oxygen. She also tested the possibility of an explosion occurring in the submarine, which she believes could have caused the deaths of the crew.\n\nHowever, other researchers have questioned Lance's findings, arguing that the evidence is not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm her theory.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

The bill would eliminate private health insurance companies and replace them with a single, government-run system.\n\nThe bill has been met with both praise and criticism. Some have praised the bill as a necessary step towards achieving universal healthcare, while others have criticized it as too expensive and unrealistic. The bill's cost has been estimated to be around $32 trillion over 10 years, which is a significant increase from the current healthcare system.\n\nDespite the criticism, the bill has gained significant momentum in recent weeks. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have expressed support for the bill. Additionally, a recent poll found that 53% of Americans support a single-payer healthcare system, while 42% oppose it.\n\nThe bill's introduction comes at a time when the healthcare system is under increasing scrutiny. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has been the subject of numerous court challenges and repeal attempts. The bill's supporters argue that a single-payer system would provide more comprehensive coverage and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.\n\nHowever, the bill's critics argue that it would be too expensive and would require significant tax increases to fund. They also argue that it would lead to long wait times and reduced access to care.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors.

In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance.

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

The opposition is also made up of civilians who are fighting against the government, as well as extremist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nThe government has responded to the opposition with force, using tanks, artillery, and airstrikes to try and crush the rebellion. The government has also been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians, which has led to international condemnation.\n\nThe international community has been slow to respond to the crisis, with many countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating.

The court found that the driver was negligent in sending and receiving text messages while driving and that her actions were a contributing factor to the accident. \n\nIn New York, lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow police to use a device called a \"textalyzer\" to determine if a driver was texting while driving at the time of a car accident.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life.

Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance—or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"—so they don't stop playing.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at King's College London, analyzed data from over 12,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on a \"geek index\" that measured traits such as intelligence, social awkwardness, and love of technology. The study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, said that the findings suggest that older fathers may be passing on genetic traits that contribute to high intelligence and geekiness.\n\nThe study's results are significant because they challenge the conventional wisdom that older fathers are more likely to have children with autism and other developmental disorders. While the study did find that older fathers were more likely to have children with autism, it also found that the same genetic traits that contribute to autism may also contribute to high intelligence and geekiness.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among scientists and the general public. Some have hailed the results as a positive development, suggesting that older fathers may be passing on genetic traits that will help solve the world's problems. Others have expressed caution, pointing out that the study's findings are based on a relatively small sample size and that more research is needed to confirm the results.\n\nOne scientist, Dr. Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, said that while the study's findings are interesting, they should not be taken as a reason to delay having children. \"The risks associated with older fatherhood are well established, and it's not worth taking the risk of having a child with a developmental disorder just to increase the chances of having a child with high intelligence,\" he said.\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the nature of intelligence and geekiness.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
