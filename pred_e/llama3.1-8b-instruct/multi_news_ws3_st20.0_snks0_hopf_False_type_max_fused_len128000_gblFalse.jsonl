Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., was a major benefactor of Jewish causes, but he was also deeply influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington and the racial-equality teachings of his rabbi, Emil Hirsch. He became a funder of Washington's Tuskegee University in Alabama and helped build over 5,300 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South, known as Rosenwald schools. These schools were a crucial part of African-American education, as segregation prohibited blacks from attending all-white schools in many Southern states. The Rosenwald Fund, which was established by Rosenwald, was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century, supporting promising black artists and helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. Rosenwald's philanthropy had a profound impact on the lives of thousands of African-American children, including civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, poet Maya Angelou, and civil rights leader Julian Bond. The documentary, which is set to be released in mid-August, aims to celebrate the affinity between African-Americans and Jews and to motivate others to continue Rosenwald's tradition of philanthropy. Rosenwald's story is an inspiring one, showing that even the most unlikely individuals can make a significant difference in the lives of others.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest.

In Fortune 500 companies, women make up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on an \"ambition gap.\" \n\nTo address this issue, companies can introduce girls to female role models, explain what leaders do, and support programs that identify and groom female talent. Introducing girls to women at the highest level of the company can make a huge difference. Companies can also highlight the accomplishments of these leaders to give them more visibility. \n\nGirls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. They need to know the specific requirements and rewards of leadership, so they can make better choices about their own careers. Companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. \n\nThe Princeton University example shows that encouragement from influential people can make a difference. The university found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade. However, after the faculty started proactively encouraging female students to apply for academic prizes, the number of female Rhodes Scholars increased to 3 out of 4 in 2011. \n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key.

However, many consumers reported that their Hatchimals did not hatch, despite following the instructions.\n\nA class-action lawsuit has been filed against Spin Master, the manufacturer of the toy, alleging that the company engaged in deceptive business practices and misrepresented the toy's capabilities. The lawsuit claims that Spin Master knew that the hatching was a key feature of the toy and that it was a major draw for consumers.

The experts, who examined the wreck, found artefacts that were not consistent with the Santa Maria, including copper alloy fixations, which were not present on the ship. They also found that the ship's construction was not consistent with the 15th or 16th century, but rather with the late 17th or 18th century.\n\nUnesco has now announced that it will look for the Santa Maria in several locations, including coastal marshland, where it believes the ship may be buried under sediment.

The team has transplanted wombs into nine women, with four of them now having embryos transferred into their new wombs. The wombs were donated by the women's mothers or other close relatives, a technique that is considered controversial. \n\nThe women who received the transplants had in vitro fertilization (IVF) before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. Dr. Brannstrom predicts that three or four of the women might successfully give birth, while one or two might get pregnant but miscarry, and one or two might not be able to get pregnant. \n\nThe transplants are intended to benefit women who are unable to have children due to the loss of their uterus. The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ, and they will be monitored closely for any complications. \n\nThe Swedish team's technique is different from other womb transplant attempts, which have used wombs from dead donors. However, experts have raised concerns about the risks of the operation for the donor, particularly if large chunks of blood vessels have to be removed. \n\nDr. Brannstrom's team has already reported \"mild rejection episodes\" in four patients, and two patients had to have their wombs removed due to complications.

{"pred": " \nAntarctic notothenioid fish have developed antifreeze proteins to protect themselves from freezing in the frigid waters of Antarctica. However, these proteins have a paradoxical effect: they not only prevent ice from forming but also inhibit it from melting. This means that the fish are left with ice crystals in their bodies, which can be detrimental to their health. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the ice crystals do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead remain intact even at temperatures above 30 degrees Fahrenheit. The researchers also found that the ice crystals are primarily located in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter them out of the blood. The study suggests that the antifreeze proteins may have a long-term cost for the fish, and that further research is needed to understand the effects of this phenomenon. The researchers also note that this discovery provides a better understanding of the progression of all species and the potential unintended consequences of evolutionary innovations. \n\nIn an interview, Paul Cziko, the lead author of the study, noted that the antifreeze proteins work differently from other antifreeze substances, such as windshield wiper fluid, and that they bind to the ice crystals in the fish's bodies, altering their surface and preventing them from growing or melting. Cziko also noted that the study highlights the importance of considering the potential anti-melting effects of antifreeze proteins, which has been overlooked in previous research. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fish and the potential risks and benefits of their antifreeze proteins. \n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between the antifreeze proteins and the ice crystals in the fish's bodies, and highlights the need for further research to understand the long-term effects of this phenomenon on the fish's health and survival. \n\nKey points:\n\n* Antarctic notothenioid fish have developed antifreeze proteins to protect themselves from freezing in the frigid waters of Antarctica.\n* The antifreeze proteins inhibit ice from melting, leading to the accumulation of ice crystals in the fish's bodies.\n* The ice crystals do not melt at their expected melting point, but instead remain intact even at temperatures above 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n* The ice crystals are primarily located in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter them out of the blood.\n* The study suggests that the antifreeze proteins may have a long-term cost for the fish", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\" (Researchers recently solved the decades-old mystery of a quacking noise detected in Antarctic waters.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1817}

Mahler, who is the son of a retired rabbi, said that he did not see evil in Bowers' eyes, but rather confusion and a lack of depth. He speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. Mahler said that he treated Bowers with compassion and empathy, and that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. Bowers, on the other hand, yelled \"Death to all Jews\" as he was wheeled into the emergency room. Mahler's father, Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, is a retired rabbi who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Mahler grew up experiencing anti-Semitism, and said that he often found swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. He developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites, including telling people that he isn't very religious. Mahler worked as a financial consultant before becoming a nurse, and he has been working at Allegheny General Hospital since March 2018. He concluded his Facebook post with a plea for love in the face of evil, saying that love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings. Dr. Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that Mahler came to him in tears after treating Bowers, and that he was proud of Mahler for doing his job. Cohen also described Bowers as \"lost\" and said that he wanted to see him with his own eyes to understand how someone could commit such a heinous act. The hospital's staff, including two Jewish medical professionals, treated Bowers with kindness and compassion, despite his anti-Semitic rhetoric.

The site, which has been excavated since 2011, has yielded evidence of one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States. A small stone tool, believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood, was found below a layer of volcanic ash that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The tool, made from orange agate, was discovered by Scott Thomas, a Bureau of Land Management archaeologist, who noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow and sage brush growing in front of it. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating that someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the archaeological community, as it suggests that humans may have occupied the western United States as far back as 15,800 years ago. This would be earlier than the previously accepted date of 13,000 years ago, which was associated with the Clovis culture. The find has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, but it has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication.\n\nThe Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is not the only site in Oregon that has yielded evidence of early human occupation. Paisley Cave, also managed by the Bureau of Land Management, is considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence.

The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline has raised concerns about the impact on the West Coast ecosystem, as sardines are a crucial food source for many species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has been urged to set conservative catch limits on sardines and to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish.\n\nThe decline has also had a significant impact on the fishing industry, with fishermen struggling to catch sardines. Captain Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish after 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel. The decline has been attributed to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines.\n\nScientists are concerned that the decline could have long-term effects on the West Coast ecosystem, including the starvation of marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen. The Pacific sardine is considered a boom-bust fish, with its numbers wildly unpredictable and surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. The collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century is a cautionary tale, and researchers are now debating how much of the current decline is caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing.\n\nThe value of sardines as \"forage fish\" is also being recognized, with scientists highlighting their importance in the ocean food web. The scarcity of sardines is believed to be a contributing factor to the malnourishment of sea lion pups that washed up on beaches in 2013. The Pacific sardine population is expected to continue to decline, and experts warn that the effects could be felt for years to come. \n\nIn conclusion, the decline of the Pacific sardine population is a pressing concern for the West Coast ecosystem and the fishing industry. The Pacific Fishery Management Council must take action to protect the sardine population and ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery. \n\nSources: \nPew Environment Group, Oceana, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

A study by the Humane Research Council (HRC) found that only 2% of the US population is currently vegetarian or vegan, while 10% have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but now consume meat. The study suggests that lapses are due to various factors, including social pressures, difficulty in addressing food cravings, and transitioning to the diet too quickly. \n\nA personal account by a former vegetarian shares a similar experience, where the individual struggled with maintaining a vegetarian diet due to a lack of motivation and a restricted palate.

The study analyzed data from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011 and found that:\n\n* About 13% of all outpatient visits in the U.S. result in an antibiotic prescription.\n* More than 40% of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia.\n* Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\nThe study's lead author, Katherine Fleming-Dutra, said that doctors often prescribe antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents. However, better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing.\n\nThe White House has announced an aggressive plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which includes reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts and the CDC have released a report outlining the baseline analysis and condition-specific targets for reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in outpatient settings. The report provides data-driven targets for eliminating the approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions issued in outpatient facilities across the country every year.\n\nThe report recommends that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole take action to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This includes:\n\n* Individual outpatient health care providers evaluating their own prescribing habits and implementing stewardship activities in their practices.\n* Health systems providing expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation.\n* Health plans assisting in data collection and analysis and providing feedback to providers on potential", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

Seven-year-old Grayson Powell won the tournament with his team, but was disqualified for wearing faded black jeans that did not meet the tournament's dress code. The rule requires participants to wear black pants. \n\nGrayson's father, Todd Powell, is outraged by the decision, claiming that the tournament director, Gord Davis, had a personal stake in the outcome and disqualified Grayson to help his hometown teams. Davis coaches teams out of a bowling alley in Corner Brook and the teams that finished second and third were from his lanes. \n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate, with Davis defending the decision and accusing Grayson's parents of breaking the rules. Davis claims that the dress code has been in place for decades and that Grayson's parents were aware of it. However, Todd Powell points out that Grayson was allowed to bowl throughout the tournament without any issues, and that the disqualification was only made after the game was over. \n\nIn a Facebook post, Davis apologized for the situation and offered to present Grayson and his team with gold medals in a special ceremony. However, the controversy has left a sour taste in the mouths of many, with some questioning the fairness of the tournament and the motives of the tournament director. \n\nThe incident has also sparked a wider debate about the importance of sportsmanship and the treatment of young athletes.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that if the Justice Department does not appoint a special prosecutor to take over the investigation, it will indicate that Comey’s firing was “part of a cover up.” Schumer also expressed fears that the decision would create a chilling effect for the next FBI director, who could fear getting fired if they “run afoul of the administration.”\n\nThe firing of Comey has sparked a wave of reactions from politicians and experts. Many Democrats have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to take over the investigation, while Republicans have insisted that one is not needed. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein’s rationale for removing Comey was sound, it would “raise questions.” Sen.

Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.\n\nThe firing of Comey has also led to a renewed call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Flynn, who is being investigated for his financial ties to Russia and Turkey.\n\nIn a bizarre timing and optics, the White House announced that Trump will meet in the Oval Office with Sergey V.

However, utility companies have traditionally recommended a south orientation for solar panels, and have refused to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south.\n\nThe study's lead author, Brewster McCracken, hopes that the findings will prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels. He notes that west-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which is when most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer.\n\nThe study's findings have implications beyond single homes, as they could lead to more efficient use of solar energy and reduced stress on utility grids. However, it's worth noting that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would translate to other seasons.\n\nOverall, the study's findings are a significant development in the field of solar energy, and could lead to changes in the way solar panels are installed and used in the future. As the use of solar energy continues to grow, it's likely that we will see more studies and research on the optimal orientation of solar panels, and how they can be used to reduce stress on utility grids and promote more efficient use of energy. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The word count is 400 words, which is the maximum allowed for a one-page summary.

The rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches, perhaps millions of years. The lake, which existed about 3.7 billion years ago, was a freshwater lake that likely covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater. The rover has also found that early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time, and that water once flowed on many parts of the planet. The rover has identified six different organic compounds, but their origin remains unclear. The rover has also found that Mars gets pounded by radiation, which would be fatal to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. However, the rover has also found that life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances. The rover has also discovered a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars, which could help find places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure.

Researchers used 3D computer tomography to examine his teeth and found that he had a broken molar and a discolored front tooth. The study suggests that Ötzi's diet, which included coarse grain and gruel, may have contributed to his dental problems. This is not surprising, as the researchers found that the frequency of cavities increased in teeth from the late Stone Age, a time when humans began to incorporate more starches into their diets.\n\nIn addition to his dental problems, Ötzi's genome has been sequenced, revealing more about his life and ancestry. The study found that Ötzi had a genetic predisposition to arteriosclerosis, a condition that is currently believed to be caused by factors such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. However, Ötzi was a hunter-gatherer and did not have any of these risk factors, suggesting that we may be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we thought.\n\nThe genome analysis also revealed that Ötzi's paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era. This suggests that Ötzi's ancestors may have been part of a small population that migrated to Europe, and that his genetic profile is most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia.\n\nThe study also found that Ötzi had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease, which was discovered in his genome. The study suggests that Lyme disease has plagued humans for thousands of years, and that Ötzi's genome may hold the key to understanding how the disease evolves.\n\nOverall, the study provides a wealth of new information about Ötzi and his life, and sheds light on the lives of our ancient ancestors.

However, subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error, and the snake was largely forgotten. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. They used Beebe's original field notes as a guide and replicated his steps to find the snake. One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. DNA analysis confirmed that the snake is a distinct species and is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" The re-discovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems.

The study, which tracked over 21,000 pregnancies, found that women who ate two to four servings of potatoes per week had a 27% increased risk of developing gestational diabetes, while those who ate more than five servings per week had a 50% increased risk. The researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Cuilin Zhang, said that the findings were important because gestational diabetes can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby. \"Gestational diabetes can mean women develop pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and hypertension,\" she said. \"This can adversely affect the foetus, and in the long term the mother may be at high risk of type-2 diabetes.\"\n\nHowever, UK experts have cautioned that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm the link between potato consumption and gestational diabetes. Dr. Emily Burns of Diabetes UK said that the study \"does not prove that eating potatoes before pregnancy will increase a woman's risk developing gestational diabetes, but it does highlight a potential association between the two.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked high-glycemic foods, such as potatoes, to an increased risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The researchers suggest that women who are planning to become pregnant should consider substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains to lower their risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nIn terms of specific alternatives to potatoes, the researchers suggest swapping in green leafy vegetables, such as kale or spinach, which are low in starch and high in fiber and vitamins.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

Anders, a 6'6\" forward, was a key member of the team and was known for his athleticism, flair, and charismatic personality. He was a hero of the team, but also had a reputation for being a bit of a troublemaker, often clashing with the coach and teammates.\n\nAnders disappeared from public view in the late 1980s, and his whereabouts were unknown for decades.

The documentary, directed by Chip Rives, features an interview with Anders, who appears in the film and says, \"A brotherly love is a very powerful thing.\" Anders was paid for his appearance in the documentary.\n\nAnders' disappearance was a mystery that had confounded his former teammates, family, and even journalists who had tried to track him down. However, Rives and his team were able to find Anders with the help of former UH player Eric Davis, a former Chicago police officer. Anders' current circumstances are not fully known, but it appears that he is living a relatively quiet life in the Detroit area.\n\nThe discovery of Anders' whereabouts has sparked renewed interest in the Phi Slama Jama team and their legacy.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans.

According to a study published in the journal Nature, the continent has lost about 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992, which is enough to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet. This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about three-tenths of an inch. The study found that the melt rate has accelerated in recent years, with an average loss of 241 billion tons of ice per year from 2012 to 2017, compared to 84 billion tons per year from 1992 to 2011.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by an international team of ice experts, used 24 different methods to assess ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations. The researchers found that the majority of the ice loss is occurring in West Antarctica, where the ice sheet is in a state of collapse. East Antarctica, on the other hand, is losing relatively little ice, but scientists are not confident that this trend will continue.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, warned that the ice sheet's loss of ice is not expected to slow down in a warming climate, and that the continent alone could contribute about half a foot to sea level rise by the end of the century. Other experts, including University of Colorado ice scientist Waleed Abdalati, agreed that the study's findings are alarming and that the forces driving the ice loss are not going to get any better in a warming climate.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with other research on the impact of climate change on Antarctica's ice sheet. For example, a study published in Nature in 2018 found that the ice sheet's grounding line, which marks the point where the ice sheet meets the ocean, is retreating at an alarming rate. Another study found that the ice sheet's collapse is being driven by warmer ocean waters, which are nibbling at the floating edges of the ice sheet from below.\n\nOverall, the news highlights the urgent need for action to address climate change and its impact on Antarctica's ice sheet.

The number of climbers on the mountain has increased significantly in recent years, and the conditions on the mountain have become increasingly unstable due to climate change.\n\nThe Himalayan Experience (Himex) team, led by Russell Brice, was the first to cancel their climb due to the unstable conditions on the mountain. Brice's decision was seen as a prudent one, given the risks involved, but it was also criticized by some who felt that he was overreacting.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the safety of the Sherpas who work on the mountain. The Sherpas are responsible for carrying heavy loads and setting up the ropes and anchors on the mountain, which puts them at a higher risk of injury or death.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

{"pred": " \nResearch has found that people can accurately judge the intelligence of men by looking at their faces, but not women. The study, conducted by researchers from the Czech Republic, used static facial photographs of 80 students and found that people were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs, but not women. The researchers found that certain facial characteristics, such as a longer face, wider distance between the eyes, and a larger nose, were associated with perceived intelligence in men, but not women. The study also found that the perception of intelligence was not based on facial shape, but rather a combination of facial features.\n\nThe researchers proposed several explanations for why people can accurately judge the intelligence of men, but not women, including the possibility that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces. They also suggested that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence, such as a longer face, wider distance between the eyes, and a larger nose, but these traits do not actually correlate with real intelligence. The researchers suggested that these facial traits may represent a cultural stereotype, rather than an actual indicator of intelligence.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of how people perceive intelligence and how it is associated with facial characteristics. The researchers suggest that the ability to accurately assess the intelligence of others may have important evolutionary consequences, and that further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this ability.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between facial characteristics and intelligence, and highlights the need for further research in this area. The study's findings also have implications for our understanding of how people perceive and judge others, and how this perception is influenced by cultural and social factors. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not include any sensational or attention-grabbing language.

LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters.

The company's success is attributed to its investments in parks, cruise lines, and Asia, as well as its film studio, which has produced hits like The Avengers. However, the success of Disney's film studio has led to a shift in the industry, with studios focusing on big-budget films that can generate spin-offs and merchandise.\n\nMeanwhile, several beloved filmmakers, including John Waters, David Lynch, and Francis Ford Coppola, are struggling to make films due to the high costs of production and marketing. The industry's shift towards big-budget films has left a gap in the market for mid-budget films, which are no longer viable due to the high costs of marketing. As a result, many filmmakers are turning to television, where they can tell more complex and character-driven stories.\n\nThe shift towards big-budget films has also led to a decrease in the number of studio films being released, with a 28% drop in studio films over the last decade. However, the number of independent films has increased, with a 100% increase in independent films over the same period. Despite this, the indie scene is becoming increasingly crowded, making it harder for filmmakers to get their films made.\n\nThe industry's shift towards big-budget films has also led to a decrease in the number of films being made by established filmmakers, with many opting to retire or focus on other projects. The loss of these filmmakers and their unique perspectives is a concern for the industry, as it may lead to a homogenization of films and a lack of innovation.\n\nHowever, there are signs that the industry may be on the verge of a change, with predictions of an implosion of the big-budget film model and a shift towards more diverse and innovative storytelling.

However, the rate of this expansion, known as the Hubble constant, has been a subject of debate among scientists. Recent measurements taken by the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the universe is expanding 5 to 9 percent faster than previously predicted. This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of research and debate among scientists, who are trying to understand the underlying physical processes that are driving this expansion.\n\nThe new measurements were made by a team of scientists led by Adam Riess, a Nobel laureate, who used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The team used a new method to calculate the distance to these galaxies, which involved measuring the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The results showed that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5 to 9 percent higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe discrepancy between the new measurements and previous estimates has sparked a range of theories and hypotheses. Some scientists believe that the universe contains unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light. Others believe that dark energy, a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, may be shoving galaxies away from each other more powerfully than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery also raises the possibility that Einstein's theory of general relativity, which is the foundation of modern cosmology, may be incomplete or incorrect. This is a significant challenge to the theory, which has been widely accepted for over a century.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and this expansion will eventually lead to the dispersal of all matter across the universe.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years.

The suspect, identified as 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof, was arrested in North Carolina after a massive manhunt. Roof had been banned from a local mall in February after employees reported him asking odd questions about their operations and when workers left for the night.

The church became a defender of freedom to worship and was deeply interwoven with freedom to do so much else. One of its founding members was Denmark Vesey, who plotted a failed slave rebellion from the church in 1822. The church was burned and its members were driven underground to worship for decades. The church rose again after the Civil War and has since become a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.

Damon stated that there is a difference between \"patting someone on the butt\" and rape or child molestation, and that both behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question. However, his comments were met with criticism from several women, including actress Alyssa Milano and Minnie Driver, who accused him of being \"tone deaf\" and \"systemically part of the problem.\"\n\nMinnie Driver, who starred alongside Damon in the film \"Good Will Hunting,\" took to Twitter to express her disappointment with Damon's comments, stating that men \"simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level\" and should not attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women. Driver also criticized Damon for defending comedian Louis CK, who has been accused of misconduct, and stated that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.\n\nAlyssa Milano also spoke out against Damon's comments, stating that the \"micro\" makes the \"macro\" and that the outrage over sexual misconduct is not just about individual incidents, but about a systemic problem. Milano also emphasized that women are not outraged because someone grabbed their butt in a picture, but because they were made to feel that this behavior was normal and that they were silenced for so long.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Damon's comments has sparked a wider conversation about the #MeToo movement and the need for men to listen and support women who have experienced sexual misconduct.

John Cornyn of Texas had a stronger phrase: \"mob rule,\" while Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois heard the \"noise of democracy.\" Democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from Kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the George W. Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time.

Wade: When the direct questions finally begin, Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on whether he'd be willing to overturn the ruling that legalized abortion, reports the New York Times. The question, said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is not whether he believes that Roe v.

The majority of the shootings took place in the 6th, 10th, and 11th districts, with gunmen targeting large crowds.

Five mass shootings, in which three or more people were shot, accounted for 25 of the shooting victims during that three-hour span. A single shooting in the Gresham neighborhood wounded eight people, including four teenage girls. The shootings were concentrated on the West and South sides, with 26 people shot in separate attacks between midnight and 6:50 a.m. on the West Side. The largest shooting, which injured eight people, happened in the South Side's Gresham neighborhood as a group, including a 14-year-old girl, was standing in a courtyard just before 12:40 a.m. The crowd had gathered after attending a funeral repass. Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller blamed gang members for taking advantage of large summer crowds to use as cover to take revenge. The gang members do not fear repercussions from the law, Waller said. \"They take advantage of that opportunity and they shoot into a crowd, no matter who they hit,\" Waller said. The police are planning coordinated enforcement that will target gangs and individuals they believe are driving violence, while police also seek to thwart retaliatory attacks.

The story included a slideshow of all 35 people currently listed as missing in the county.\n\nOne of the missing persons, Rebekah Martinez, was reported missing by her mother in November 2017, but was later found to be alive and well, having appeared on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor.\" Martinez's case highlights the challenges of investigating missing persons cases, particularly when the missing person is an adult who has chosen to cut off contact with their family.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has stated that they take all missing persons reports seriously and follow up on all leads. However, the office also acknowledges that some missing persons cases are more challenging to investigate than others, particularly those involving adults who have chosen to disappear.\n\nThe North Coast Journal's investigation found that many of the missing persons in Humboldt County are adults who have chosen to leave their families and friends behind, often to work in the cannabis industry. The county's remote location and lack of cell phone service can make it difficult for investigators to track down missing persons.\n\nThe investigation also found that some missing persons cases are not actually missing, but rather, the person has chosen to disappear and is not cooperating with investigators. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office has stated that they will not remove a person from the missing persons list unless they have been found to be deceased or have been located and cleared.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) is a federal database that connects each case with a caseworker who compares it against reports, looks for patterns, and collaborates with families and local law enforcement. The database includes several Humboldt County area reports that don't appear on the Attorney General's website.\n\nThe investigation also highlighted the challenges faced by families of missing persons, particularly those who are searching for loved ones who have disappeared in connection with the cannabis industry.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

The hackathon aims to address the current problems with breast pumps, including their loud motors, multiple parts, difficulty in cleaning, and lack of discretion. The event is part of a larger effort to improve maternal and neonatal health, which is an area that \"lags behind others\" in innovation.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about improving breast pumps, but also about making life better for moms, babies, and new families. The event is being organized by a group of MIT Media Lab students and researchers who are also parents, and they are bringing together people from diverse fields, sectors, and backgrounds to take a crack at making life better for families.\n\nSeveral projects have already been developed as a result of the hackathon, including Compress Express, Second Nature, PumpIO, Helping Hands, and Mighty Mom utility belt. These projects aim to improve the design and functionality of breast pumps, making them more discreet, efficient, and user-friendly.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about innovation, but also about raising awareness about the importance of breastfeeding and the challenges that women face in pumping breast milk. The event is being supported by several organizations, including Vecna Technologies, Pejman Mar Ventures, Medela, Naia Health, and Ameda.\n\nThe breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, and it's time for a redesign.

Snowden, 30, fled Hong Kong on Sunday and arrived in Moscow, where he booked a flight to Cuba. However, he did not show up on the flight, leading to speculation about his whereabouts. \n\nThe U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and revoked his passport, making it difficult for him to travel. The U.S. has also asked Russia to extradite Snowden, but Russia has not confirmed whether it will comply. \n\nSnowden has applied for asylum in Ecuador, and the country's foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, has said that Ecuador is considering his application. Ecuador has a history of defying the U.S. government, and its president, Rafael Correa, has been a vocal critic of U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere. \n\nThe U.S. government has expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Snowden to leave despite a request for his detention. The Hong Kong authorities said that the U.S. request did not fully comply with Hong Kong law, but the U.S. Justice Department rejected this explanation. \n\nSnowden's leaks have caused a stir in China, where the government has been accused of hypocrisy for criticizing the U.S. for its surveillance programs while engaging in similar activities. The Chinese government has said that it is relieved that Snowden is no longer in Hong Kong, but analysts believe that Beijing may have been using Snowden to further its own interests. \n\nThe situation has also raised questions about the role of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, who has been advising Snowden. Assange has said that WikiLeaks helped arrange Snowden's travel documents and that the group is committed to protecting Snowden's rights. \n\nThe U.S. government has expressed concern that Russia or Hong Kong may have had advance notice of Snowden's plans to flee and still allowed him to leave. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said that it would be \"deeply troubling\" if this was the case. \n\nOverall, the situation is complex and has raised questions about the balance between national security and individual rights.

Four other people, including a police officer, were injured.\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has questioned why Monis was not on the country's terror watch list and has promised to examine the circumstances surrounding the siege. An investigation has been launched into the police operation and the motives of Monis.\n\nMonis' background and motivations are still unclear, but it is believed that he was a self-styled Muslim cleric who had become increasingly radicalized in recent years. He had a history of religiously inspired activism, but officials say there is as yet no evidence his actions were linked to international Islamist movements.\n\nThe siege has left the city of Sydney in shock and has raised questions about the effectiveness of the country's counter-terrorism measures. The Australian National Imams Council has issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing sympathy for the families of the victims. A church service was held at Sydney's St Mary Cathedral to mourn the victims and Archbishop Anthony Fisher urged Australians not to be caught up in \"violence and its cycle of recrimination\". \n\nThe incident has also highlighted the growing threat of lone wolf attacks", "answers": ["As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

The coalition, co-founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, consists of mayors from 43 states, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. In 2013, the coalition released a report showing that thousands of individuals with criminal records were seeking to illegally buy guns through online sales. The investigation found that over 25,000 guns could be transferred to individuals with criminal records through the online gun listings on Armslist.com. In response, the coalition launched a national drive to reduce gun violence, which included a rally in Washington, D.C. and a new television ad demanding action from Congress. The coalition also released a new poll showing that voters overwhelmingly support background checks for all gun sales. In 2012, the coalition launched a campaign against national concealed carry reciprocity, which would allow individuals to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit. The coalition also released a report showing that states and federal agencies fail to send millions of records to the federal firearms background check system, enabling substance abusers and the mentally ill to buy guns. In 2011, the coalition launched a national drive to fix gun checks, which included a billboard truck that kept a running toll of the number of Americans murdered by guns. The coalition also released a report showing that the nation's criminal background check system is flawed and that dangerous individuals can easily obtain firearms. The coalition's efforts have been supported by President Obama, who has expressed his support for fixing the background check system and closing loopholes that enable criminals to avoid these checks.

The attack was the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing on a synagogue in 2002. The gunmen, who were wearing military uniforms, opened fire on tourists as they were getting out of buses, and then took hostages inside the museum. Security forces entered the museum around two hours later, killed the two gunmen, and freed the captives.\n\nThe victims of the attack included tourists from Japan, Italy, Poland, Spain, Australia, France, and the UK.

The review, which is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI, will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review has found that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000. Of 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory’s microscopic hair comparison unit, 26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed so far. The cases include those of 32 defendants sentenced to death, 14 of whom have been executed or died in prison.\n\nThe FBI has acknowledged that hair examiners until 2012 lacked written standards defining scientifically appropriate and erroneous ways to explain results in court. The bureau expects this year to complete similar standards for testimony and lab reports for 19 forensic disciplines. The review has also found that examiners made statements exceeding the limits of science in about 90 percent of testimonies, including 34 death-penalty cases.\n\nThe review has been ongoing since 2012, but it was halted last August due to a debate within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards to apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony. The review resumed this month at the order of the Justice Department. The FBI has searched more than 21,000 federal and state requests to its hair comparison unit from 1972 through 1999, identifying for review roughly 2,500 cases where examiners declared hair matches.\n\nThe review has found widespread problems with the FBI’s hair and fiber analysis unit, which has led to the convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people.

While Finding Dory continued its ascension with the biggest domestic third weekend of all time for an animated movie, The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG brought in meager results. The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Roald Dahl's beloved book, earned $18.6 million on its opening weekend, which is a paltry number considering its $140 million budget. The film's fate will rely heavily on the international box office, where it has opened in only two territories so far. If it doesn't work offshore, partners Disney, Amblin Entertainment, and Walden Media are looking at a sizable loss.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance has been a disappointment, and many are wondering what went wrong. Some of the reasons include Spielberg's lack of a surefire hit in recent years, the book's relatively low awareness among modern families, the confusing acronym title, the lack of recognizable faces, and the steep $140 million budget. The film's marketing campaign also failed to convey the emotional bond between the giant and the young orphan girl, which is the film's bread and butter.\n\nThe BFG's performance is a rare misstep for Spielberg, who has a long history of making successful films. However, this is the first time he has directed a film that was intended primarily as a commercial venture. The film's failure implies that the idea of a Steven Spielberg fantasy film is no longer an event, and that such a thing does not have the pull that it once did.\n\nDespite the disappointing box office performance, Spielberg will likely be fine, and Disney will also be okay. The BFG's failure is not a reflection of Spielberg's talent as a filmmaker, but rather a sign of the changing times in the film industry.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

Many of these women are sold to Chinese husbands or tricked into thinking they are heading to jobs in China, only to find themselves stuck in remote villages with no way to communicate with the locals. The women are often forced to perform sex acts on camera for men, who pay them a few dollars a day. Some women are even held prisoner by pimps and forced into this work.\n\nAccording to a local source, a group of female North Korean workers was recently forcefully repatriated from China after it was discovered that they had been working as prostitutes on the sly. The women had been placed under strict living conditions, including being barred from traveling outside their lodging alone, and were forced to engage in illegal activities, including prostitution, at the behest of their handler.\n\nThe Chinese government has been criticized for not doing enough to protect North Korean women from human trafficking and exploitation. The State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report noted that North Korean women and girls are subjected to sexual slavery, forced prostitution, and other forms of exploitation in China.\n\nSome North Korean women have turned to online sex work as a way to make money, with about one-fifth of the women living in hiding in China involved in this type of work. However, this work is often safer and more lucrative than other options, and many women feel they have no choice but to engage in it.\n\nOne woman, Suh, who fled North Korea in 2008, resorted to doing \"video chatting\" after her second child was born and her husband's earnings wouldn't stretch any further. She earned $3 on her first day and $120 in her best week, but eventually decided she couldn't take it and tried to leave with two other women. They were helped by a broker and a pastor from South Korea and made their way to Laos, where they are now being held at a detention center.\n\nSuh has applied for asylum in the United States, despite speaking no English and knowing she will receive little support. The United States has accepted 74 refugees from North Korea since Kim took power, according to State Department data.\n\nThe situation for North Korean women in China is dire, and many are forced to make difficult choices in order to survive. The Chinese government must do more to protect these women from human trafficking and exploitation, and the international community must also take action to address this issue. \n\nNote: The summary is a one-page summary", "answers": ["\"Why are our lives so different, just because of where we are born?\" That's the question posed to the Washington Post by Suh, a 30-year-old North Korean woman now being held in a Bangkok detention center after being busted by local cops while trying to cross from Laos to Thailand. And this is only her most recent travail: Suh and two other women interviewed by the Post were trying to flee their lives as sex \"video chatters\" in China, an online profession many women are sucked into after first escaping North Korea—either by willingly getting sold to Chinese men to get out of their home country, or after being tricked into thinking they were being hired for jobs in China, only to end up as human trafficking victims. Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia. North Korean women trying to survive there often fall into the online \"video chatting\" business, allowing them to bring in some extra cash from the safety of their own homes. But it's a demeaning, demoralizing trade. \"I felt so disgusting,\" Suh says. And it's what led Suh (who brought her 18-month-old daughter with her, but had to leave her 5-year-old daughter behind) and the two other women to try to escape once more—this time to Laos, then to Thailand, where they wouldn't have been able to be repatriated back to North Korea.

The study, which was published in the BMJ Open journal, involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40 who had been bereaved. The researchers found that those bereaved by suicide were also 80% more likely to drop out of education or work.\n\nThe study highlights the profound impact that suicide can have on friends and family members, and suggests that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help limit its impact on people's lives. The researchers found that people who had been bereaved by suicide tended to perceive more social stigma around the death, and that when the results were adjusted for perceived social stigma, the significant differences in suicide attempts and occupational functioning disappeared.\n\nThe study also suggests that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk. This is because previous studies have shown that family history of suicide is a risk factor for suicide attempt, and the new study found that people who had been bereaved by suicide were more likely to experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these outcomes are not inevitable, and that support is available for those who have been bereaved by suicide. They suggest that simple gestures, such as offering practical help with day-to-day activities, can make a big difference in helping people cope with their loss.\n\nThe study's findings are significant because they highlight the need for greater awareness and understanding of the impact of suicide on friends and family members. It also suggests that addressing social stigma and providing support to those who have been bereaved by suicide can help limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nIn addition to the UCL study, other research has shown that people who are exposed to suicide, either directly or indirectly, are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This is known as \"suicide contagion.\" Contagion can occur through various means, including reading about a famous suicide in the news or experiencing the death of a friend or family member.\n\nOverall, the studies suggest that suicide has a profound impact on friends and family members, and that addressing social stigma and providing support can help limit its impact on people's lives.

However, Jabhat al-Nusra's leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has since claimed that his group was not consulted about the merger and has instead pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda's overall leadership.\n\nThe merger has raised concerns among Western powers, who have been providing non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition. The US has designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organization due to its links with Al Qaeda, and the merger is likely to further complicate the situation.

Al Qaeda's North African and Yemen-based franchises have both announced their affiliation with the group in times of weakness, but Al-Nusra's merger comes at a time of great success on the battlefield. The group has been the most effective fighting force in Syria, and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing Assad.\n\nHowever, the merger announcement may have unintended consequences for Al-Nusra.

Despite his initial promise as a front-runner in Iowa, Walker's campaign was marred by poor debate performances, missteps on key issues, and a lack of fundraising success. Walker's exit marks the second major Republican candidate to drop out of the race, following former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Walker's decision to leave the race has sparked a scramble among other candidates to win over his supporters and donors. Several candidates, including Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have already begun to court Walker's staff and donors, with some expressing optimism about their chances of winning the nomination. Walker's departure has also raised questions about the viability of the remaining candidates, particularly Donald Trump, who has been criticized for his divisive rhetoric and lack of policy experience. As the Republican field continues to narrow, attention is turning to the party's ability to coalesce around a single candidate and present a united front against the Democratic nominee. Walker's exit has also highlighted the challenges faced by Republican candidates who are seen as too closely tied to the party establishment, and the importance of building a strong grassroots organization and fundraising operation. Despite his disappointing campaign, Walker remains a respected figure in Republican circles, and his decision to drop out has been met with a mix of sadness and understanding from his fellow candidates.

A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News.

Trump said that he and Kim had \"developed a very special bond\" and that things were \"very, very good — excellent relationship.\" Kim said that he and Trump have \"decided to leave the past behind.\" The joint statement did not define \"security guarantees\" or what \"complete denuclearization\" entails, and critics said that the pomp and ceremony surrounding the summit lent too much prestige to Kim, a dictator who imprisons and murders his opponents.\n\nThe summit was a day of pleasantries, but little public substance.

Hyde-Smith initially refused to apologize for the remark, but later said she was sorry \"for anyone that was offended.\" \n\nDespite the controversy, Hyde-Smith's campaign was able to depict Espy as too liberal for Mississippi, a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982.

{"pred": " \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, has a complex history with plural marriage. The practice of plural marriage was introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church, in the 1840s. According to the Church, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to practice plural marriage, and he did so, marrying multiple wives and authorizing other Church members to do the same. The practice was seen as a trial of faith for many who participated in it, and it was a source of controversy and opposition.\n\nThe Church believes that monogamy is the Lord's standing law of marriage, but that the Lord also commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage in biblical times. The practice was seen as a way to \"raise up seed unto the Lord\" and to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant. Plural marriage was practiced by some Church members in the 19th century, and it resulted in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes.\n\nHowever, the practice of plural marriage was also a source of difficulty and hardship for many women and men who participated in it. Women who entered into plural marriages often had to leave their families and homes, and they risked reputation and self-respect by being associated with a principle that was foreign to their culture. Men who practiced plural marriage also faced challenges, including the need to balance their relationships with multiple wives and to navigate the complex social and cultural norms of the time.\n\nThe Church's practice of plural marriage was also a source of controversy and opposition from outside the Church. In the 1860s, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage, and Church members who continued to practice it were prosecuted and fined. In 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff issued a statement known as the Manifesto, which declared the Church's intention to submit to the laws of the United States and to discontinue the practice of plural marriage.\n\nToday, the Church no longer practices plural marriage, but it continues to teach that marriage can last beyond death and that eternal marriage is essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. The Church also permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries, and it allows members to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married.\n\nOverall, the history of plural marriage in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The court held that the Eighth Amendment was designed to protect those convicted of crimes, and that corporal punishment in public schools is not a punishment for a crime. The court also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require notice and hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in public schools. The court found that the common law remedies for excessive corporal punishment are adequate to afford due process.\n\nHowever, the use of corporal punishment in public schools remains a contentious issue. In Alabama, corporal punishment is still legal and common, with nearly 40,000 students being paddled in 2000. The number has dropped by about half since then, but it is still a significant issue. The state's law allows local school boards to adopt their own codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures, and many schools in Alabama use corporal punishment as a regular part of the discipline process.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents be encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing undesired behavior. The academy also recommends that parents be encouraged to use positive reinforcement strategies to increase desired behaviors and to remove reinforcement or apply punishment to reduce or eliminate undesired behaviors.\n\nIn contrast, many other states have banned corporal punishment in public schools. The Global Initiative to End Corporal Punishment reports that 49 nations, including most of Europe and South America, have outlawed the use of corporal punishment both in schools and in the home. The American Psychological Association also opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools, juvenile facilities, child care nurseries, and all other institutions where children are cared for or educated.\n\nThe use of corporal punishment in public schools has been linked to negative effects on children's attitudes toward and achievement in school. Many studies have shown that paddling has a negative impact on children's behavior and academic performance.

The hackers have gained access to an aging, outdated power system, with many substations and equipment decades old and unable to handle electronic threats. The grid is a lucrative target for hackers, who can gain control of physical assets such as power plants, substations, and transmission equipment.\n\nThe hackers have been using various methods to gain access to the grid, including using contractors that sell software and equipment to energy companies. They have also been using smart meters, which measure electricity usage and share information with the grid, to gain access to the system. The hackers have been able to steal sensitive information, including user names and passwords, and detailed engineering drawings of power plants.\n\nThe U.S. government has been aware of the threat for years, but has struggled to respond effectively. The Department of Homeland Security has helped more than 100 energy and chemical companies improve their cyber defenses, but the full extent of the attacks on the grid is not public knowledge. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation collects information about cyber incidents involving utilities, but the details are confidential and exempt from disclosure.\n\nThe companies themselves say they are vigilant, but no fortifications are foolproof. American Electric Power, the nation's largest power grid operator, had a close call when an operations supervisor unwittingly downloaded malware called CryptoLocker, which could have locked up the business and operations networks.

The study, which tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors, found that the rate of teenagers using nicotine, either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes, is on the rise. In 2014, about 14% of 12th-graders said they had smoked or vaped in the past 30 days, compared to 9% in 2004.\n\nThe study suggests that e-cigarettes are recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use, and that nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction for youth who never used any other tobacco products. The researchers found that older teens who experiment with electronic cigarettes are six times more likely to try regular cigarettes within about a year when compared to those who have never vaped.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Pediatrics found that e-cigarette use in never-smoking youth may increase the risk of subsequent initiation of cigarettes and other combustible products during the transition to adulthood when the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal. The study, which followed a cohort of adolescents in Southern California, found that e-cigarette users had more than six times the odds of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette users.\n\nThe use of e-cigarettes has been linked to an increased risk of smoking initiation among adolescents, and the long-term consequences of e-cigarette use are not yet known.

The conference has argued that such a delay would infringe on the right to freedom of association, a symbolically potent argument that has withstood through the years. However, some higher education leaders, including former Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman, have argued that delaying recruitment can save lives by giving freshmen more time to find their way and make better decisions.\n\nSince 2005, more than 60 people have died in incidents linked to fraternities, and many more have been seriously injured. Lawsuits against fraternities are becoming a growing matter of public interest, with many cases involving hazing, rape, and other forms of violence. The fraternity industry has responded by developing a risk-management policy that aims to transfer liability to outside parties and protect its massive assets from juries.\n\nFraternities have also been criticized for their handling of crises, with some arguing that they prioritize protecting their own interests over the well-being of their members. The Fraternal Information and Programming Group (FIPG) has developed a comprehensive crisis-management plan that includes steps such as closing the fraternity house to outsiders, summoning all members back to the house, and having a designated member handle press relations.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this plan is designed to protect the fraternity's interests rather than the well-being of its members. They also point out that the plan can lead to members being separated from the fraternity, dropped from insurance, and blamed for their actions.\n\nThe financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, with parents often being forced to pay for their child's legal defense and damages. Some have argued that the fraternity system is \"the largest industry in this country directly involved in the provision of alcohol to underage people.\"\n\nIn recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving fraternity-related deaths and injuries, including the death of a freshman at California Polytechnic State University who died after drinking a large amount of alcohol during an initiation ritual.

As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

From its early days as a platform for sharing information to its current status as a global phenomenon, the internet has undergone significant changes. In this summary, we will highlight some of the most significant websites and innovations that have shaped the internet into what it is today.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential websites is Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001. Wikipedia has become a global encyclopedia, with millions of articles in hundreds of languages. It has refined its system of volunteer editors and citation requirements, making it a self-correcting organism that is prone to some errors but mostly steers itself back towards the truth.\n\nAnother significant innovation is Google, which was launched in 1998. Google's simple search bar has remained relatively unchanged since its first iteration, and its PageRank algorithm has taken much of the chaos out of online search. Google's ever-improving AI means that users can search for specific information and find exactly what they are looking for.\n\nThe internet has also given rise to social media platforms, including Facebook, which was launched in 2004. Facebook has become a global phenomenon, with over 2 billion users. It has also given rise to other social media platforms, including Twitter, which was launched in 2006. Twitter has become a platform for real-time news and information, with users able to share their thoughts and opinions on a wide range of topics.\n\nThe internet has also enabled the creation of online communities, including Reddit, which was launched in 2005. Reddit has become a platform for sharing and discussing a wide range of topics, from news and politics to entertainment and culture. It has also given rise to other online communities, including 4Chan, which was launched in 2003.\n\nThe internet has also enabled the creation of online marketplaces, including eBay, which was launched in 1995. eBay has become a platform for buying and selling a wide range of goods and services, from electronics to collectibles. It has also given rise to other online marketplaces, including Amazon, which was launched in 1994.\n\nThe internet has also enabled the creation of online entertainment platforms, including Netflix, which was launched in 1997. Netflix has become a platform for streaming movies and TV shows, with a vast library of content available to users. It has also given rise to other online entertainment platforms, including Hulu, which was launched in 2007.\n\nThe internet has also enabled the creation of online news platforms, including The Onion, which was launched", "answers": ["It’s time, Gizmodo declares, \"to start building a canon of the most significant websites of all time.\" In putting together a list of the \"100 Websites That Shaped the Internet as We Know It,\" the Gizmodo staff considered sites (not apps or services) \"that influenced the very nature of the Internet, changed the world, stole ideas better than anyone, pioneered a genre, or were just really important to us.\" And Gizmodo is quick to point out that a spot on the list doesn't mean the website is good (\"a number of sites on this list are cesspools\").

Recently, several news outlets have reported that Craig Steven Wright, an Australian computer expert and entrepreneur, may be the creator of Bitcoin. The reports are based on a series of clues, including old blog posts, leaked documents, and emails, that suggest Wright was involved in the development of Bitcoin.\n\nWright, who has been living in Sydney, Australia, has been identified as a possible creator of Bitcoin by Wired magazine and Gizmodo. The reports suggest that Wright was involved in the development of Bitcoin with Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013. Wright has been quoted as saying that he \"did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009\" and that \"by the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know.\"\n\nThe Australian authorities have raided Wright's home in suburban Sydney as part of a tax investigation, but a spokesman for the Australian Federal Police said that the raid had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The raid came hours after the reports were published, and efforts to reach Wright were unsuccessful.\n\nThe reports have sparked a lot of interest and debate, with some people believing that Wright is the real Satoshi Nakamoto and others thinking that it is a hoax. If Wright is indeed the creator of Bitcoin, it would be a significant revelation, as it would mean that the identity of the person behind the digital currency has finally been revealed.\n\nThe reports also raise questions about the future of Bitcoin and the potential impact on its price and the wider cryptocurrency market. If Wright's trust fund, which contains 1.1 million Bitcoins, is unlocked in 2020, it could potentially tank the price of Bitcoin. The reports also suggest that Wright may have been involved in the development of Bitcoin with Kleiman, and that the two may have worked together to create the digital currency.\n\nOverall, the reports about Wright being the creator of Bitcoin are significant and have sparked a lot of interest and debate.

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright—founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo—blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $60 million in Bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million Bitcoins worth $605 million—the same amount attributed to Nakamoto. \"I am not from the bloody USA! Nor am I called Dorien [sic],\" Wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day Newsweek claimed American Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin's inventor.

{"pred": " \n\nHurricane Harvey has caused unprecedented flooding in Houston, Texas, and the surrounding areas. The storm has raised questions about the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such devastating storms. While scientists agree that climate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive, they are cautious about attributing any individual storm to climate change. However, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey is likely to strain America's capacity to coalesce as a national community at a moment of heightened political conflict and division. The response to the storm will raise larger political questions on at least two major fronts: the cost of recovery and the role of climate change in intensifying the risk of such devastating storms. Each of those issues will challenge America's ability to surmount its differences enough to set a shared national direction.\n\nThe cost of recovery from the storm is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and Congress will face unprecedented partisan divides over Washington's role in meeting those costs. In the past, Congress has faced similar debates over funding for natural disasters, with some lawmakers insisting on offsetting aid with spending cuts elsewhere.\n\nClimate change is also a major concern, with scientists warning that it is increasing the risk of catastrophic storms like Harvey. The dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is warming both the ocean and the air, leading to more intense hurricanes. However, President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as a \"hoax\" and is withdrawing the US from the Paris global climate accord.\n\nThe media has been criticized for not adequately covering the role of climate change in the storm, with some arguing that it is too sensitive a topic to discuss during a disaster. However, others argue that it is irresponsible to leave climate change out of the story, as it is a major factor in the severity of the storm.\n\nIn a recent study, researchers found that anthropogenic warming is impacting the zonal mean temperature profile in a manner conducive to wave resonance and a consequent increase in persistent weather extremes in the boreal summer. The study suggests that climate change is making severe downpours more likely, and that the damage from natural disasters is likely to increase in the future.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey has also raised questions about the role of climate change in exacerbating the storm's impact. While scientists are still studying the storm, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future. The storm has dumped about 1 million gallons of water", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change—particularly when talking about a single weather event—the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

An officer approaches Flores' seemingly lifeless body 30 seconds later, grabs his arm, and drags him along the ground. An ambulance arrives just before the video ends. Police say they first tried to subdue Flores, 41, with a Taser and shield before shooting him, per the San Antonio Express-News. It isn't clear how many shots were fired or how many times Flores was hit. Police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head, holding a baby who may have been injured, per KSAT. They say Flores, who had a criminal record, was there holding a knife. \"Certainly, what's in the video is a cause for concern,\" a sheriff tells the New York Daily News. \"But it's important to let the investigation go through its course.\" A district attorney agrees the video is \"troubling,\" telling KSAT, \"There's actually another video with a better view that is very close.\" He adds, \"There's a lot of information before, including 911 calls and information from different witnesses inside the house.\" On Facebook, Bexar County police slam KSAT for posting the video, calling the move \"unethical and sad\" and \"sensational behavior,\" noting it has resulted in \"physical threats toward our deputies.\" Vasquez and Sanchez are both on administrative leave."], "all_classes": null, "length": 8009}

The prisoners were not just \"civilians\" as Obama claimed, but were actually accused of posing threats to national security. Three of the prisoners were part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with U.S.-made microelectronics, while another was serving an eight-year sentence for conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware. The administration also dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of whom were fugitives. The investigation has sparked outrage among federal law enforcement officials, who were kept in the dark about the deal and were shocked and angry when they learned about it. The Obama administration's decision to grant clemency to the prisoners has been described as a \"scandal\" by non-proliferation expert Valerie Lincy. The investigation has also revealed that the Obama administration began to slow-walk investigations into Iranian procurement networks as far back as 2014, and that the Justice Department was pressured to drop cases against Iranian suspects.

The company's success was a result of Ma's ability to merge Western entrepreneurship with a deep understanding of the Chinese market.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was a major concern. The disease spread rapidly, killing over 6,000 people and infecting thousands more. However, the bravery and selflessness of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and aid workers, helped to contain the outbreak. TIME magazine named the Ebola fighters as its Person of the Year, recognizing their tireless efforts to combat the disease.\n\nIn the Middle East, the conflict between ISIS and the Kurdish people was a major concern. The Kurds, led by Massoud Barzani, were fighting for independence and were supported by the US. The conflict was marked by brutal violence and human rights abuses, but the Kurds remained determined to establish their own state.\n\nIn the US, the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum in 2014, following the deaths of several unarmed black men at the hands of police. The movement sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform. The protests were marked by violence and looting, but also by acts of kindness and solidarity.\n\nIn Russia, President Vladimir Putin's decision to annex Crimea from Ukraine was a major event in 2014. The move was widely condemned by the international community, but Putin's approval ratings soared in Russia. The annexation was seen as a symbol of Russia's resurgence as a global power, but it also led to economic sanctions and a decline in Russia's international reputation.\n\nIn Liberia, the Ebola outbreak had a devastating impact on the country's healthcare system. The disease spread rapidly, and the government struggled to contain it. However, the bravery and selflessness of healthcare workers, including Dr. Jerry Brown, Dr. Kent Brantly, and Dr. Mosoka Fallah, helped to contain the outbreak.\n\nOverall, 2014 was a year marked by significant events that shaped the world. From the business world to the healthcare sector, the Middle East to the US, and Russia to Liberia, the year was marked by conflict, tragedy, and resilience.

Trump responded by calling on Ginsburg to resign, saying that her comments were \"dumb political statements\" and that her mind is \"shot.\"\n\nGinsburg's comments have sparked a debate about the ethics of judges speaking out on politics. Some have argued that she has crossed the line and compromised her impartiality, while others have defended her right to free speech. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which outlines the rules for judges' behavior, states that judges should not \"publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.\" However, it also allows for judges to engage in extrajudicial activities, such as speaking and writing, as long as they do not compromise their impartiality.\n\nGinsburg's comments have also raised questions about the potential impact on her legacy and her ability to hear cases involving Trump.

The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige … to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal—but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

{"pred": " \nA breakthrough in brain-computer interface technology has enabled patients with complete locked-in syndrome (CLIS) to communicate with the world through a device that detects patterns in brain activity. The technology, developed by a team of neuroscientists at the University of Tübingen, allows patients to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions by detecting changes in blood flow in different regions of the brain. The device uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow and a computer learns to distinguish the patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nFour patients, aged 24 to 76, were trained to use the system and were able to answer questions about their quality of life, including whether they were \"happy\" with life. To their surprise, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life, suggesting that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell many presume it to be. However, not all answers went down well, with one patient advising his daughter not to marry her boyfriend.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Plos Biology, do not mean that all locked-in patients are content with their lives. However, they do suggest that patients with locked-in syndrome have reported a good quality of life before, even matching that of healthy people of the same age. The reasons for this are unclear, but neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer believes that patients may become focused on the good social interactions around them and even experience something akin to a state of meditation because they cannot feel or move their bodies.\n\nThe technology has the potential to transform the lives of people who are too disabled to communicate and could be used to allow patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. Birbaumer is working on a new system that would allow patients to communicate more freely, and other neuroscientists are exploring the use of the technology to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of locked-in syndrome and the quality of life of patients with this condition. They suggest that patients with locked-in syndrome may be more content with their lives than previously thought, and that the technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate with patients who are unable to speak or move. \n\nThe study's lead author, Niels Birbaumer, said that the findings were \"one of the most satisfying moments of my life\" and that the technology has the potential to \"abolish completely locked-in syndrome", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. “It’s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,” says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.)

McConnell said the American people should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and that the vacancy should not be filled until a new president is elected.\n\nScalia was a fierce conservative on the court, known for his originalist approach to interpreting the Constitution.

The story has also highlighted the dysfunction of The Weinstein Company's board of directors, which allowed Harvey Weinstein to stay in power for over a decade despite his alleged misbehavior.\n\nThe board's inaction was due in part to the fact that the bylaws and ownership structure of The Weinstein Company made it nearly impossible for independent board members to influence the brothers' behavior. The board consisted of nine members, with the Weinstein brothers holding two seats and the right to name a third director to represent the W shares. The A shares, owned by outside investors, had equal voting rights, but the operating agreement granted the W shareholders full control over all decisions involved in running the studio.\n\nTwo directors, Tarak Ben Ammar and Lance Maerov, have spoken out about the board's dysfunction and the fact that they were blocked by Harvey Weinstein's allies from removing him from power. They claim that Weinstein bullied and insulted employees, directors, and his brother, squandered outside investors' money, and ran the company as a personal fiefdom. Ben Ammar and Maerov have also revealed that they were aware of Weinstein's alleged misbehavior, including the groping scandal and other revelations, but were unable to take action due to the company's bylaws and the influence of Weinstein's allies.\n\nThe scandal has also led to a number of settlements and nondisclosure agreements being made between Weinstein and his accusers. One such agreement was made with Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an Italian model who accused Weinstein of groping her in 2015.

The mission aims to study the sun's corona, which is hotter than its surface, and the solar wind, which affects Earth's magnetic field and can cause disruptions to technology. The spacecraft will travel closer to the sun than any previous probe, within 4 million miles of its surface, and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission will help scientists understand the physics of stars and improve space weather forecasting, which can help protect Earth's technology from solar radiation. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the sun's heat. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice. The spacecraft will make 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete. The findings from the mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The mission is a testament to the importance of Parker's body of work and his discovery of solar wind, which has revolutionized our understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. The spacecraft will be the first to visit the sun and will provide unprecedented insights into the sun's behavior and the solar wind.

However, the cause of its sinking has been a mystery for over 150 years. Researchers have proposed various theories, including suffocation, damage to the hull from arms fire, and a lucky shot theory. However, a new study published in PLoS One suggests that the crew died instantly from the shockwave triggered by their own torpedo.\n\nThe study, led by biomechanist Rachel Lance, used a 1/6 length-scaled model of the Hunley to test the effects of the blast wave on the crew. The results showed that the blast wave would have caused catastrophic injuries to the crew, including pulmonary trauma and brain injuries. The study also found that the crew would have had enough oxygen to breathe for at least two hours, making suffocation an unlikely cause of death.\n\nLance's study is significant because it provides new insights into the physiology of human beings and the physical forces we're able to endure. The study also highlights the importance of injury biomechanics in understanding the effects of blast injuries.\n\nThe Hunley Project, a team of researchers and scientists at Clemson University, has been studying the Hunley for 17 years and has not been able to determine the cause of its sinking. However, Lance's study provides a new explanation for the crew's death and may finally put the mystery of the Hunley to rest.\n\nThe study's findings have been met with skepticism by some researchers, who argue that the blast wave theory is not supported by previous studies.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code—changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] … persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.

A Harvard student, Aran Khanna, discovered this issue and created a Chrome extension called Marauder’s Map, which maps the locations of users who send messages on Facebook Messenger. The extension was downloaded over 85,000 times and received significant media attention, including coverage from CNN, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. Facebook responded by asking Khanna to disable the extension and deactivating location sharing from the desktop webpage. However, the company did not change its default settings for geolocation sharing on the Messenger app.\n\nKhanna’s extension revealed that Facebook Messenger shares users’ locations with anyone in a group chat, regardless of their relationship to the sender. The extension also showed that users can be tracked to within a meter using the latitude and longitude coordinates of their messages. Khanna found that he could infer a schedule for his friends and even track the locations of people he was not Facebook friends with.\n\nThe issue of geolocation sharing on Facebook Messenger has been raised before, but Facebook did not take significant action to change its software. Khanna’s extension and blog post made the issue more transparent and raised public concern, leading Facebook to make sharing geolocation data an opt-in feature. However, the company did not disclose with whom it would share the previously collected data.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of transparency and public pressure in addressing privacy concerns. It also raises questions about the responsibility of companies like Facebook to protect users’ privacy and the need for users to be aware of the data they are sharing.\n\nIn related news, a study published in Technology Science found that Facebook Messenger collects and shares users’ geolocation data by default, and that users are not aware of this practice.

The plan would be funded through a combination of taxes, including a 2.2% income tax on all Americans, a 6.2% levy on employers, and tax hikes on the wealthy. The bill has gained support from several Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have all cosponsored the bill.\n\nThe bill would phase out the current system over a four-year transition period, with Medicare being expanded to cover dental, vision, and hearing aid services in the first year. The eligibility age for Medicare would be reduced to 55 in the first year, 45 in the second year, and 35 in the third year, with everyone being eligible by the fourth year.\n\nThe bill has been met with skepticism by some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has not cosponsored the bill. However, single-payer activists are celebrating the momentum gained by the bill, with many seeing it as a step towards transforming the health care system into a more patient-centered and equitable system.\n\nThe bill has also been criticized by Republicans, who argue that it would be too expensive and would lead to a loss of employer-provided health insurance. However, Sanders and his supporters argue that the bill would actually save Americans money in the long run by eliminating private insurance costs and reducing administrative waste.\n\nThe bill's introduction comes at a time when public support for single-payer health care is increasing, with 53% of Americans supporting a national health care plan, according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The bill's popularity is also growing among Democratic officeholders, with several senators possibly looking to run for the party's presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nOverall, the introduction of the \"Medicare for All\" bill marks a significant step towards a more comprehensive and equitable health care system in the United States. While the bill faces significant legislative obstacles, it has gained momentum and support from key Democratic senators and activists, and is likely to remain a major issue in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn related news, the Republican-controlled Congress is also working on a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, with several Republican senators introducing a new plan that would cut and reshape Medicaid,", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post. Sanders has the support of 15 Democratic senators so far, including all of those seen as potential 2020 presidential candidates.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The Apollo 11 spacecraft was launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, and after traveling through space for four days, it entered into lunar orbit. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin suited up in their spacesuits and descended to the moon's surface in the lunar module Eagle, while Michael Collins remained in orbit around the moon in the command module Columbia. After landing on the moon, Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the lunar surface, famously declaring \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface shortly afterwards, and the two astronauts spent about two and a half hours exploring the moon's surface.

Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous.

Dylan's lecture was recorded on June 4 and submitted to the Swedish Academy, which awarded him the Nobel Prize in December. Dylan has been accused of lifting passages from various poets and novelists for his song lyrics in the past, and this is not the first time he has been accused of plagiarism.

The law, known as SB 1070, was passed in 2010 and aimed to crack down on illegal immigration in Arizona. The court ruled that the state cannot require immigrants to carry registration papers, prohibit illegal immigrants from seeking work, or allow police to stop and arrest people they suspect of being deportable. However, the court upheld the provision that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.\n\nThe ruling has been met with mixed reactions. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer hailed the decision as a \"victory for the rule of law\" and a \"legal victory\" for her state. She also blasted President Barack Obama's \"failed\" immigration policy, saying that the federal government has failed to secure the border and protect its citizens. Brewer also emphasized that she would not tolerate racial profiling by law enforcement officials.\n\nOn the other hand, the Obama administration has welcomed the decision, saying that it confirms the federal government's exclusive authority to regulate immigration. Attorney General Eric Holder said that the ruling appropriately bars the state of Arizona from effectively criminalizing unlawful status in the state.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, however, was critical of the decision, saying that it \"boggles the mind\" in light of the Obama administration's new policy ending deportations of many young adults brought into the country illegally.

He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move.

The investigation revealed a complex web of relationships and motives, involving drugs, sex, and betrayal.\n\nThe main suspects, Kenneth Brunke, 46, Garry Cordell, 47, and Marietta Carlson, 28, were arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and kidnapping. However, the case took a dramatic turn when Marietta Carlson died in jail, and Garry Cordell changed his story, claiming that Brunke was not involved in the killings.\n\nBrunke, a former Schoolcraft County Road Commission employee, was found to have been trafficking heavily in drugs in the region, supplying cocaine and morphine to street-level dealers. He had a history of depression and suicide threats and was known to be a quiet but menacing man.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Brunke had lured Aldrich to his house with the promise of free morphine, and she had stolen drugs from him, which led to the killings. However, the motive behind the killings was not just about the stolen drugs, but also about Brunke's anger towards Aldrich for spurning his affection and posting on Facebook about another man.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the handling of the investigation and the plea deal made with Brunke. The prosecutor, Timothy Noble, has been criticized for allowing Brunke to plead to obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer, which could have him out of prison in five years or less.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver at the time of a fatal accident could be held liable for the accident, as long as they knew the driver was texting and would view the text while on the road. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation. However, the knowledge requirement set by the Pennsylvania judge may make it difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in suits against third parties.\n\nIn New York, lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow police officers to use \"textalyzers\" to determine whether drivers were using their phones in a way that is not in accordance with state laws. The bill would also require drivers to hand over their phones after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit has been filed against Snapchat for allegedly \"motivating\" an 18-year-old driver to drive recklessly, resulting in a serious car accident. The lawsuit claims that Snapchat's speed-measuring feature encouraged the driver to drive at high speeds.\n\nUniversity of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith believes that these developments may signal a shift in how society views distracted driving, making it less socially acceptable and potentially leading to more stringent laws and regulations. However, it is unclear whether phone and app developers will be held accountable for accidents caused by their products.\n\nIn a related case, a New Jersey appeals court ruled that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted. The court also concluded that the sender did not have a duty to avoid sending text messages to a person who is driving, but rather that the sender must have knowledge that the recipient will view the text while driving.\n\nOverall, these developments suggest that the legal system is starting to take distracted driving seriously and may lead to more stringent laws and regulations to prevent accidents caused by texting and driving.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver—it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases.

He also emphasized the importance of outreach to the poor and less fortunate, and his speeches often focused on parables of human struggles resolved through faith.\n\nMonson was a beloved leader among Mormons, known for his warm and caring personality. He was a devoted husband and father, and his family was a priority to him. He was also a devoted fisherman and homing pigeon breeder, and he enjoyed show tunes, Boy Scouts, and the Utah Jazz.\n\nMonson's legacy will be tied to the church's efforts to hold tight to its opposition of same-sex marriage while encouraging members to be more open and compassionate toward gays and lesbians. He also introduced a policy that lowered the minimum age for missionaries from 21 to 19 for women and from 19 to 18 for men, which led to a historic influx of missionaries.\n\nMonson's death has been met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from around the world.

The allegations against Ailes included unwanted advances, propositions, and even assault. Ailes had a history of abusive behavior, dating back to his time at NBC in the 1990s, where he was accused of making threatening comments and intimidating employees.\n\nThe lawsuit against Ailes was settled for $20 million, with Fox News agreeing to a public apology.

{"pred": " \nThe Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has released a report on the earnings of America’s top 350 CEOs, revealing a significant pay gap between workers and bosses. According to the report, the average CEO earned 312 times more than their workers in 2017, with some CEOs earning as much as 3,101 times more than their employees. The pay gap has been increasing steadily since the 1990s, with the ratio of CEO to worker pay rising from 20 to 1 in 1965 to 344 to 1 in 2000.\n\nThe report also found that CEO pay has been driven by stock-related components, such as stock awards and realized stock options, which accounted for nearly all of the growth in CEO compensation from 2016 to 2017. The value of exercised stock options grew by 47.1 percent, while the value of stock awards grew by 8.4 percent.\n\nThe EPI report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is not unique to the United States, with similar trends observed in other countries. The report suggests that the pay gap is driven by a combination of factors, including the power of CEOs to extract concessions from their companies and the market for skills.\n\nThe report also highlights the impact of CEO pay on the broader economy, noting that the growth of top 1 percent incomes has been disproportionately driven by households headed by CEOs and other high-income earners. The report suggests that policies aimed at reducing CEO pay and increasing wage growth for workers could help to address income inequality.\n\nThe EPI report is based on data from Compustat, a commercial database that provides information on executive compensation. The report uses a methodology that compares CEO compensation to the median worker in the main industry of the CEO’s company, which provides a more accurate picture of the pay gap than the SEC’s calculated ratio.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is not just a symbolic issue, but has real-world consequences for workers and the broader economy. The report suggests that policies aimed at reducing CEO pay and increasing wage growth for workers could help to address income inequality and promote economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the EPI report highlights the significant pay gap between CEOs and workers in the United States, and suggests that policies aimed at reducing CEO pay and increasing wage growth for workers could help to address income inequality and promote economic growth.

His wife, Stacy, was unaware of the extent of his addiction and only discovered the truth after his death.\n\nThe article also explores the ways in which casinos and slot machine manufacturers design their machines to be addictive. The use of virtual reel mapping, which allows for the creation of near-miss results, is a key feature of modern slot machines. This feature is designed to give players the impression of almost winning, which can lead to increased playing time and addiction. The article also notes that casinos use data from loyalty cards and other sources to track the behavior of their customers and target those who are most likely to become addicted.\n\nThe article cites research that shows that problem gamblers generate a significant portion of casino revenue, with some studies suggesting that they account for 30-60% of total revenue. The article also notes that casinos have developed formulas to calculate the \"predicted lifetime value\" of individual gamblers, with the biggest losers referred to as \"whales.\" These gamblers are targeted with customized perks and VIP treatment, which can further encourage their addiction.\n\nThe article also discusses the case of Caroline Richardson, a woman who lost nearly $2 million at the Ameristar Casino in Iowa.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life.

However, they note that the findings do not necessarily mean that men should delay fatherhood in order to have more intelligent sons.\n\nThe study's authors also suggest that the link between older fathers and geekiness may be due to the fact that older fathers are more likely to have a stable home environment, which encourages geeky traits.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. “Our primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those ‘geeky’ traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of ‘geekiness.’” (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 8472}
