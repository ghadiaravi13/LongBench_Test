This was highlighted by Angela Burns, who noted that four years ago, universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less keen to deploy them for the students, preferring to build up their war chest. The meeting also discussed how the reserves of universities were a measure of their financial health, but that a large amount of these reserves were tied up in their estates and were not immediately realisable.
