In other cities, the Occupy movement has been met with force, with police using riot gear and making arrests.

Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin. The inventor of the AK-47, who was a slave of God, had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention, but in his letter, he expressed his guilt and questioned his responsibility for the deaths of people killed by his rifle.

According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the immune system's defenses, making it harder to kill. The study found that macrophages, or immune cells, were unable to effectively kill MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract, as the bacteria had altered its cell walls to repel toxic substances and antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, the study discovered that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls, and was able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The researchers also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited. MRSA divides rapidly, with a single cell able to generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens, such as MRSA, more aggressive and resistant to the immune system's defenses. This has significant implications for public health, as cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for infectious diseases, including MRSA. The study's authors hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence that cigarette smoking is a major contributor to the spread of infectious diseases and that individuals should refrain from smoking to protect their health.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research on the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance, which found that e-cigarette vapor also made MRSA more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. However, the study's authors found that cigarette smoke extract made MRSA more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and was able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier to invade and cause infection.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the importance of cigarette smoking as a major contributor to the spread of infectious diseases, including MRSA, and emphasize the need for individuals to refrain from smoking to protect", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

However, when the study was conducted across 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, Adolf Hitler was found to be the most important person.\n\nThe study aimed to discover if the online encyclopedia was skewed in the level of attention it gives to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. The researchers found that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries that use the language of the edition.\n\nThe researchers used a method called PageRank, which is still used by Google to decide the importance of webpages. However, the results were odd, and the most important person in the world was found to be Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist.

The investigators claimed that the gang, known as Pishtacos, had murdered up to 60 people and sold their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, the police investigation was botched, and it was later revealed that there was only one murder victim, who was linked to the cocaine trade. The four alleged killers, who are still in custody, may have bottled the victim’s fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. The police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, with anthropologists saying that they foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend and played on people’s fears to explain the murder. The police have also been accused of scaring away tourists and distracting the public from the real issues facing Peru.

According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA), the number of hikers has risen from 300 in 2006 to over 4,000 in 2016. This has led to concerns about overcrowding and the potential for environmental damage. The PCTA has implemented a quota system, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day, in an effort to mitigate these issues.\n\nHowever, some hikers are concerned that the quota system may not be enough to address the problem of overcrowding. The PCT is a fragile ecosystem, and the increased number of hikers has led to issues such as degraded vegetation, establishment of new camp spots, and human waste. Additionally, the increased number of hikers has resulted in a higher number of rescues and searches, which can be costly.\n\nDespite the concerns about overcrowding, the PCT remains a popular destination for hikers. The PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and responsible hiking practices. This includes protecting water quality, burying human waste, and building safe campfires.\n\nThe increase in hikers has also led to a rise in the number of women hiking the PCT. According to the PCTA, the number of women hiking the PCT has risen from 10 percent to 30 percent in recent years.\n\nThe PCT is not the only destination for hikers. The Appalachian Trail, which spans from Georgia to Maine, is also a popular destination. A new movie adaptation, A Walk in the Woods, is set to be released later this year, which is based on Bill Bryson’s book about two middle-aged friends attempting to walk the trail.\n\nOverall, the PCT remains a popular destination for hikers, but the concerns about overcrowding and environmental damage are a reminder of the importance of responsible hiking practices. The PCTA and other organizations are working to address these issues and ensure that the trail remains a safe and enjoyable destination for hikers. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it is not a one-page summary in the sense that it is a single paragraph.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The dinosaur lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period and was a small, bird-like theropod with a long, shallow skull and a prominent crest above its eyes. The most striking feature of Caihong juji is its iridescent feathers, which were found to be similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were preserved in the fossil and were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and other techniques. The analysis revealed that the feathers were made up of platelet-like nanostructures, which are similar to those found in the feathers of modern birds. The researchers were able to predict the colors of the feathers using discriminant function analysis and found that they were likely to be a rainbow of colors, including red, green, and blue. The researchers believe that the iridescent feathers were used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or showing off to other dinosaurs. The discovery of Caihong juji has provided new insights into the evolution of feathers and the origins of birds. The researchers also found that the dinosaur had a unique tail, which was frond-like and had asymmetrical feathers. The tail was likely used for flight, but the researchers are not sure what the functions of the tail were.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.\n\nThe incident highlights the risks of relying on smartphone apps for navigation in mountainous terrain. The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team leader, Detective Constable Tim Bird, said that the app would have shown a small and not detailed image, making it difficult to navigate. He also noted that the team had to attend to 30% of incidents on Tryfan, which is considered a hazardous route for unwary walkers.\n\nMountain Rescue England and Wales spokesman Andy Simpson urged walkers to use a map and compass in addition to electronic navigation aids. He noted that batteries on mobile phones can run out just when needed most, and that electronic maps can be difficult to read in detail.\n\nThe incident also raises questions about the suitability of light boots for rough terrain. Jane's boots were not suitable for the terrain, and she could have slipped and fallen.\n\nThe coroner's conclusion of accidental death suggests that the incident was a result of a combination of factors, including the reliance on smartphone apps for navigation and the unsuitability of Jane's boots for the terrain. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of using proper navigation tools and being aware of the risks involved in mountain walking. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, approximately 500 words. \n\nReferences:\n1.

The BBC reports Jane Wilson and her husband Gary were hiking on Tryfan in Wales when it started to get dark and they decided to skip the summit. While attempting to descend the mountain, Gary was looking at an Ordnance Survey app while Jane went a short way ahead to make sure the path was safe, according to the Telegraph. The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with Ordnance Survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \"due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world.\" Authorities also say Jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

According to the lawsuit, Arias was a sales executive for Intermex from February 2014 to May 2014, and she was required to use the app, called Xora, which tracked her location and monitored her activities. Arias claimed that the app was used to monitor her location during non-work hours, and she objected to this, saying that it was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed her boss that his actions were illegal. However, her boss, John Stubits, told her that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer.\n\nArias was fired a few weeks later, and she claims that this was a result of her refusal to install the app. Her attorney, Gail Glick, said that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest to do so, but if an employee cannot stop it, then that is a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Intermex fired Arias in retaliation for her objection to the app, and it also claims that the company interfered with her ability to earn a livelihood by contacting her previous employer, NetSpend, and telling them that she was disloyal.

{"pred": " \nA recent study published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics has found that frequent use of acetaminophen, commonly found in over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol, during pregnancy may be associated with a higher risk of ADHD-like behavioral problems in children. The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study, found that mothers who reported using acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had children with a higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD or receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe study's authors, led by Dr. Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that mothers who reported using acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more had children with a 50% increased risk of receiving ADHD medication. However, the study's authors emphasized that the results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and that the association may be due to other factors such as maternal hormones or genetic predisposition.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among health experts, who are urging pregnant women to be cautious when using acetaminophen. Dr. Ritz, who is also a professor and chair of the epidemiology department at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, advised pregnant women to \"try to avoid taking painkillers as much as I can until we know more about this.\"\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may interfere with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. However, other experts have questioned the study's findings, citing the lack of a clear cause-and-effect relationship and the fact that ADHD runs in families.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted, and the need for further research on the topic. Health experts are urging pregnant women to consider alternative pain relief methods, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture, rather than relying on medications.\n\nThe manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has stated that the company is aware of the study's findings, but that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.

Cosby was declared a “sexually violent predator” under state law. His defense team made fiery accusations of racism and sexism in statements outside the courthouse, framing Cosby’s downfall as an unjust product of the #MeToo era. Cosby’s publicist, Andrew Wyatt, said that Cosby’s defeat was part of the “sex war” happening in Washington, comparing it to accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh that are roiling the capital. Wyatt also called Cosby’s trial the “most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States,” saying that Cosby was “one of the greatest civil rights leaders” and a “great educator of men and boys.” Wyatt has repeatedly argued that racism played a role in Cosby’s conviction in not-so-subtle terms, calling the April trial a “public lynching.” Cosby was taken to SCI Phoenix, a new 3,830-bed state prison in suburban Philadelphia, where he will serve his sentence.

Kavanaugh’s nomination has been met with strong opposition, with many calling for the FBI to investigate his claims before a vote on his nomination takes place.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Neiman Marcus has apologized for the breach and said it does not believe the customers' Social Security numbers or birth dates were compromised. However, the company has faced criticism for not telling customers about the breach sooner. Target, on the other hand, has said that card numbers from 40 million customers were stolen, along with encrypted PINs for debit cards. It also estimated that other personal information belonging to 70 million people was stolen by the hackers. Both Neiman Marcus and Target have said they do not believe the two attacks are related. However, a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both breaches, examining whether the two attacks are related.
