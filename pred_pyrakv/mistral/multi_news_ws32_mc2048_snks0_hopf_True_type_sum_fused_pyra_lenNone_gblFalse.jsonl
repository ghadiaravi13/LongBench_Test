MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections and is often resistant to antibiotics. The studies found that both types of smoke alter the structure of MRSA's cell walls, making them more resistant to the immune system's defenses and antibiotics.\n\nIn the first study, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, the immune cells responsible for engulfing and destroying bacteria. The MRSA was also more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, two lines of defense used by the immune system. Additionally, MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, increasing its chances of invasion. The more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became.\n\nThe second study found that cigarette smoke extract stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to survive against reactive oxygen species. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, meaning a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendants in 12 hours.\n\nThe studies challenge the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly harms the smoker and instead suggest that smoke makes the pathogen tougher.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other and cannot be explained by a single pose or position.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of debate and analysis. It is 14-feet-long and 11-feet-wide and has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390. The Vatican regards it as an icon, but it is not officially recognized as a religious relic. The cloth was last displayed to the public in 2015, attracting over 2 million visitors, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe researchers used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, hoping to answer the debate over the crucifixion depicted on the cloth. Instead, they found that the bloodstains were inconsistent with each other and could not be explained by a single pose or position. The hand stains, for example, were found to correspond to different angles, and the spear wound stain did not match the pattern seen on the cloth.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the cloth appear to be patched on, suggesting that a standing model was used to create the image. Borrini told BuzzFeed News that this is the kind of forensic work done in police investigations and that it would be fascinating to know exactly how the image was created on the fabric.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The alleged ring involved multiple women, some of whom may have been as young as 15, who were reportedly plied with drugs and threatened.\n\nThe men are currently being held pending dangerousness hearings on November 29 to determine if bail should be set and in what amount. The investigation began in the spring of 2017 and focused on areas of First, Adam, North, Linden, and Wahcone streets. Many of the women were recruited by a white male named \"Randy,\" who would photograph them and post advertisements online seeking clients for sexual services.\n\nPolice identified Lambach as the owner of a blue station wagon used to transport the women and identified him via photographs as the man known as \"Randy.\" One woman told police she had been prostituted by Lambach for about a year and had sex with him for money or to pay off a debt on multiple occasions. Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and agree on a date, time, location, and fee. Rates were typically $80 for 30 minutes or between $160 and $200 for an hour.\n\nLambach would then transport the women to their appointments and collect the money, keeping anywhere from 50 to 100 percent of it. He allegedly threatened to turn the women in if they stopped working for him and warned them that the police would not believe them because they were \"drug addicts and whores.\"\n\nVan Wert allegedly allowed some of the meetings to take place in his third-floor apartment in a senior living facility in exchange for drugs and cash. Lambach also worked as a chauffeur, transporting the women to and from specific locations and waiting until they were done. He allegedly recruited about 10 other women in a similar manner and provided narcotics to those who used drugs before having sex.\n\nAdditional charges may be coming as the investigation remains ongoing.

The permit system, which limits the number of hikers to 50 per day, was introduced in 2015 as a response to the environmental impact and potential financial strain on essential services.\n\nThe PCT is known for its serene natural beauty and challenging terrain, which can be life-changing for hikers. However, the influx of inexperienced hikers can lead to negative consequences, such as overcrowding, degradation of campsites, and financial burdens on local communities. The PCT Association launched the #responsiblywild campaign to promote safety and leave-no-trace practices.\n\nThe PCT is not just for long-distance hikers; it also offers shorter hikes for those who want to experience the trail without committing to a multi-month journey.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Detective Constable Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, told the inquest that the change in route was an attempt to traverse the west face to avoid the summit but that it would have been better to have retreated the way they had come or gone to the North Ridge. He also warned against relying solely on smartphone apps for navigation in the mountains and urged walkers to use a map and compass instead. The inquest recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

However, the tax has faced strong opposition, with critics arguing that it doesn't make people healthier, doesn't raise revenue, and drives up the cost of living for low-income families. The tax has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade costing over $26 at Costco. As a result, customers are voting with their feet and buying drinks outside the city to avoid the tax. The tax has also been criticized for being regressive and job-killing. Seattle's tax is not the first of its kind, as Cook County, Illinois repealed its soda tax within months due to public backlash and revenue losses. The west coast is known for social engineering policies, with California being one of the top five states with paternalistic laws. The soda tax has been particularly burdensome for businesses, with one company, Markstein's, estimating that the tax has cost them over $70,000 so far. The tax has also led to confusion and inconsistency, as it does not apply to all sugary drinks and leaves out large retailers like Starbucks.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

{"pred": "\n\nThe U.S. government is facing a potential shutdown as Congress struggles to pass a new funding bill before the deadline on Monday. The House of Representatives passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, but it includes conditions related to the Affordable Care Act, which Senate Democrats have vowed to reject. House Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from conservative Republicans to delay the implementation of the health care law, but this stance increases the likelihood of a government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against the House's proposal and is urging Democrats to make Republicans cave in the fiscal crisis. A government shutdown could have significant economic consequences, particularly for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to a large concentration of federal workers and contractors. An estimated $200 million a day could be lost, and more than 700,000 jobs could be affected. Federal services such as trash collection and libraries could be halted in the District, and mail delivery would continue as an independent agency. The possible shutdown comes at a time when the region's economy is already weak, with across-the-board sequestration cuts costing the area 60,000 jobs in August. The impact of a shutdown would be felt beyond the Washington D.C. area, with serious ripple effects on state and local governments and communities. Lawmakers are urging against a shutdown, with Rep. Gerry Connolly stating that it would have a disproportionate effect on the Washington region, where the federal government makes up one-third of the economy. The 1995 government shutdown, which lasted for three weeks, had widespread consequences, including the closure of national parks, the halt of passport processing, and the delay of work on bankruptcy cases. The current impasse in Congress could lead to a shutdown affecting every federal agency, with serious consequences for essential services and the economy.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, which is set to launch in summer 2018, will come closer to the sun than any spacecraft before it, providing unprecedented insights into solar phenomena and their impact on Earth. The probe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its effects on space weather, which can cause damage to satellites and power grids.\n\nParker, a University of Chicago professor, is credited with predicting the existence of solar wind and solar flares in the 1950s. He was thrilled to learn that the mission bearing his name would finally provide answers to long-standing questions about the sun's behavior. The mission's objectives include tracing the solar wind and its structure, understanding the mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind, and studying the solar corona and its magnetic fields.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will face extreme temperatures and radiation, requiring advanced engineering solutions to protect the spacecraft and its instruments. The mission's budget is $1.5 billion, and it is expected to last for 7 years. The probe will travel at speeds up to 430,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest human-made object in history.\n\nThe renaming of the mission marks the first time NASA has named a spacecraft after a living scientist. Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said that Parker's groundbreaking work had inspired generations of scientists and that the mission was a fitting tribute to his legacy. Parker himself expressed his excitement about the mission and the potential discoveries it could make.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is expected to provide valuable data on solar activity, which can impact communication systems, navigation, and power grids. The mission's findings could lead to improved space weather forecasting and better protection for satellites and other space assets. Additionally, the mission could shed light on the fundamental physics of the sun and its role in the solar system.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

This idea, originally proposed by astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that civilizations progress through three stages: Type I, which harvests all resources on a planet; Type II, which harvests all the energy from a star; and Type III, which harvests all the energy from a galaxy. Hooper adds a new twist, suggesting that civilizations may need to capture stars from other galaxies to prevent them from becoming inaccessible due to the expanding universe. The second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are large structures proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and physicist Freeman Dyson that could be used by advanced civilizations to harness the energy of a star. These structures could be made up of a swarm of satellites that surround a star and collect its energy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

During his tenure, the show set a record for unauthorized appropriations while Kilborn was chairman of the Commerce Committee. This was revealed in a clip from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in 2015.\n\nJon Stewart, who took over as host in 1999, had initially hoped for a fun and successful show, but his wildest dream was not to become a cultural touchstone. The Daily Show's format loosely followed a conventional news broadcast, with a focus on satirizing the news and politics of the day. The creative process in the early years was led by co-creators Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg, with Craig Kilborn as the host.\n\nWhen Kilborn left in 1998, Stewart was brought in as his replacement. The transition was not without challenges, as some staff members were resistant to Stewart's ideas and approach. However, Stewart was able to hire key collaborators like Ben Karlin, David Javerbaum, and Stephen Colbert, who helped shape the show's direction and tone.\n\nThe Daily Show's success came at a time when traditional news sources were undergoing significant changes. Network news anchors like Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather were still dominant figures, but cable news and the internet were beginning to disrupt the industry. The Daily Show's satirical take on news and politics resonated with a younger audience and helped establish the show as a cultural force.\n\nThe show's field pieces, which sent correspondents to cover news stories, were a particular strength. These segments often involved correspondents adopting the persona of serious news anchors or reporters, only to reveal the absurdity of the situation they were covering. Carell, Colbert, and Stewart were among the correspondents who made significant contributions to the show during this period.\n\nThe Daily Show's impact on politics and culture was significant. The show's satire helped to expose the hypocrisy and absurdity of political figures and campaigns, and it helped to shape the way that younger audiences engaged with news and politics. The show's influence can be seen in the proliferation of satirical news programs and the increasing use of humor and satire in political campaigns and discourse.\n\nIn", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment.

The studies, which focus on findings from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, reveal that around 300,000 years ago, hominid populations responded to long-term environmental and climatic changes by becoming more mobile and innovative.\n\nThe researchers found distinct differences in stone tool technology from this period, with smaller, standardized tools appearing, which they classified as Middle Stone Age industries. These tools required an understanding of space and time, as they were made from raw materials transported over long distances. The studies also discovered the earliest evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials in the form of obsidian, which was used to make tools.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin was once home to early humans, who faced unpredictable food sources due to environmental changes. To adapt, these populations became more mobile and innovative, leading to the development of new tool technologies and the use of exotic materials. The findings suggest that expanded social networks, information transmission, and technological innovation were present among these early human populations.\n\nThe studies challenge the Eurocentric view that modern behaviors only emerged as humans migrated out of Africa. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors were present among African populations much earlier than previously believed. The researchers emphasize that more research is needed to understand the relationship between complex behaviors and hominid species during the period when many hominid species inhabited Africa.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, many people on Twitter mocked Schiller's statement, comparing it to real acts of courage such as the Selma march or facing a tank.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it is a technological regression and an example of Apple's hubris, arrogance, or even stupidity. The loss of the headphone jack means that users will have to rely on Apple's proprietary Lightning port or Bluetooth for audio output. Some users have expressed concerns about the sound quality of Bluetooth headphones and the inconvenience of having to carry around additional accessories.\n\nThe decision to remove the headphone jack has also affected other devices that use the jack, such as credit card readers and temperature sensors. Apple has not provided a clear explanation for why it made this change, with some speculating that it was done to save space inside the iPhone for other features.\n\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus also feature new stereo speakers, water resistance, and improved cameras.

The AirPods will be available in late October.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising Apple for pushing the industry forward and others expressing frustration and disappointment. The decision has sparked a larger debate about the role of technology companies in shaping consumer behavior and the importance of compatibility and convenience.\n\nOverall, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus represent the latest iteration of Apple's flagship smartphone, with new features and design elements that aim to differentiate the device from competitors.

The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, was primarily cosmetic but brought significant psychological benefits for the young boy. Kieran, who has struggled with his appearance and bullying at school, expressed his desire for \"normal\" ears and the ability to wear sunglasses and earphones. His mother, Louise, supported his decision and hoped for her son to be accepted like other children.\n\nThe procedure involved the removal of cartilage from both sides of Kieran's ribcage, which was then shaped and grafted onto his head under pockets of skin. The team used an outline of Mrs. Sorkin's ears as a \"family template\" to create the new ears as close to the original shape as possible. The surgery, which took six hours, was a major operation but brought significant improvements in quality of life for children with microtia, according to Bulstore.\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, although most are for creating one missing ear. The psychological benefits of the procedure are immense, as it significantly boosts the confidence of young patients.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering may lead to less invasive methods of ear reconstruction in the future. Scientists at the University College London Institute for Child Health are researching the use of stem cells to grow new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures. This approach would be far less invasive than the current treatment, but for the foreseeable future, children needing new ears will benefit from the same procedure used at Great Ormond Street Hospital.\n\nKieran was delighted with the result of the surgery and expressed his excitement when shown a mirror three days after the procedure.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

{"pred": "\n\nScientists have made significant discoveries about Mars' ancient water history through the analysis of atmospheric water and its isotopes. The findings suggest that Mars once had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere, making it a more promising place for alien life. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep, held over 20 million cubic water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. The evidence comes from studying the atmospheric water isotopes, specifically deuterium, which indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past. The higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere suggests that Mars had at least 137 meters of water equivalent to a global ocean. The discovery challenges the previous belief that flowing water was an erratic presence on Mars and adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth. The research was conducted using data from three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world, including Nasa's Keck Observatory, Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, and the European Southern Observatory. The findings also support the idea that Mars was once habitable and open the possibility of the existence of life on the planet. The European Space Agency is sending its Exomars rover to Mars in 2018 to search for chemical signs of life. Additionally, Nasa's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court found that Nestlé had failed to provide sufficient evidence that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. Mondelez, the American chocolate giant, had objected to the trademark and appealed the decision in 2016. The court also dismissed some of Mondelez's grounds for appeal. The ruling means that the EU Intellectual Property Office must review the 2012 decision and consider new evidence. The case has implications for brands operating in the EU single market and has been closely followed by trademark lawyers. The dispute between the two multinational companies has also been mirrored in a trademark dispute in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to Mondelez's trademark for the purple color used to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The case has at times been discussed in the context of the Brexit debate, with some suggesting that EU courts are threatening British treats.

The Norwegian Kvikk Lunsj, which has been around since 1937, has been compared to the Kit Kat and has gained national pride in Norway for its long-standing image as a meal on the go for healthy hikers. The two treats were in harmony for 65 years until Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat in 2002.

Instead, new research suggests that dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, producing sounds similar to coos or mumbles. This theory is based on the study of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds, which have evolved independently at least 16 times in large, bodied species. The researchers analyzed the distribution of this behavior among birds and other reptilian groups, and their findings indicate that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations was likely present in some extinct nonavian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study, which will be published in the August issue of the journal Evolution, is part of a new collaboration funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the array of sounds it can produce. The researchers identified 52 out of 200 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalizations, and they found that this behavior is most common in large-bodied birds.\n\nWhile no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like, the findings from this study offer some clues. Dinosaurs, as members of the archosaur group, likely had large bodies and the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations. This theory challenges the popular image of dinosaurs as ferocious roarers and suggests that they may have made quieter, more subdued sounds during mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that more research is needed to fully understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors produced. Future studies will integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to shed light on this fascinating aspect of dinosaur biology.\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood's portrayal of dinosaurs as roaring beasts continues to captivate audiences, but the new research suggests that the truth may be more complex and intriguing than previously thought.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

By piecing together brain patterns as subjects watched YouTube videos, scientists were able to reconstruct the videos based on neural activity recorded by an MRI machine. This is the first time that scientists have been able to read a dynamic visual experience continuously, as opposed to static images. The researchers believe this technology could pave the way for eventually being able to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation, including dreams and thoughts. Jack Gallant, a coauthor of the study, described it as a major leap towards reconstructing internal imagery and opening a window into the movies in our minds.

The reconstructed videos are blurry due to the layering of all YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. The technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, allowing people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. However, the potential use of the technology in detective work or court cases raises ethical concerns.

The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million obese individuals, but other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Central America, have even higher obesity rates. Obesity is a complex issue fueled by the availability of cheap, unhealthy food and sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers, and causes approximately 3.4 million adult deaths annually. The problem is not limited to rich countries; it is affecting people of all ages, income levels, and regions. Not one country has managed to reduce its obesity rate in the past thirty years. The number of obese and overweight individuals has increased by 28% in adults and 48% in children over the past 33 years. The most affected regions are the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 50% of adults are obese or overweight. Obesity is appearing at younger ages, with a 50% increase in children and adolescents. The rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in rich countries, but it continues to rise in developing countries.

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians continued voting in the third round of parliamentary elections on January 2, 2012, while former President Hosni Mubarak faced trial for his role in the violent suppression of protests that led to his ouster in February 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's mainstream Islamist group, was expected to consolidate its lead in the elections, with some estimates suggesting it could win a clean majority of seats in the new parliament. The trial of Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons, resumed after a three-month hiatus, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his three-decade presidency to ensuring his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Mubarak, who has been held in a hospital since his arrest in April, could face the death penalty if convicted of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters. The military rulers, led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, have yet to specify the powers of the new parliament and its relationship to the military council. Clashes between security forces and protesters in Cairo left at least 17 people dead in December, and opposition to military rule was growing, with protests planned for January 25 to mark the anniversary of Mubarak's ouster. Egypt's economic growth had slowed significantly, with foreign reserves down by $35.5 billion and the benchmark Egyptian Stock Exchange index losing 43.5% of its value in 2011.
