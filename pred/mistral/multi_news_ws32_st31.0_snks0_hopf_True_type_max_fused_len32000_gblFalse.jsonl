Recently, two researchers, Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, conducted a forensic analysis of the shroud's bloodstain patterns using a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA). Their findings, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggest that the shroud may be a fake.\n\nThe researchers used a mannequin and synthetic blood to replicate the bloodstains on the shroud and found that the patterns were inconsistent with those that would be produced by a crucified person. They also discovered that some of the stains were impossible to explain based on the position of the mannequin or the flow of blood. The researchers concluded that the shroud's bloodstains were not authentic and that the cloth may have been manipulated or forged.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has long been a source of controversy, with some believing it to be a genuine relic and others viewing it as a fake.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.
